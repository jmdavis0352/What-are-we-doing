We assess the hypothesis that an analytic cognitive style is associated with a history of questioning, altering, and rejecting (i.e., unbelieving) supernatural claims, both religious and paranormal. In two studies, we examined associations of God beliefs, religious engagement (attendance at religious services, praying, etc.), conventional religious beliefs (heaven, miracles, etc.) and paranormal beliefs (extrasensory perception, levitation, etc.) with performance measures of cognitive ability and analytic cognitive style. An analytic cognitive style negatively predicted both religious and paranormal beliefs when controlling for cognitive ability as well as religious engagement, sex, age, political ideology, and education. Participants more willing to engage in analytic reasoning were less likely to endorse supernatural beliefs. Further, an association between analytic cognitive style and religious engagement was mediated by religious beliefs, suggesting that an analytic cognitive style negatively affects religious engagement via lower acceptance of conventional religious beliefs. Results for types of God belief indicate that the association between an analytic cognitive style and God beliefs is more nuanced than mere acceptance and rejection, but also includes adopting less conventional God beliefs, such as Pantheism or Deism. Our data are consistent with the idea that two people who share the same cognitive ability, education, political ideology, sex, age and level of religious engagement can acquire very different sets of beliefs about the world if they differ in their propensity to think analytically.},

The present studies apply a dual-process model of cognitive processing to this problem, testing the hypothesis that analytic processing promotes religious disbelief. Individual differences in the tendency to analytically override initially flawed intuitions in reasoning were associated with increased religious disbelief. Four additional experiments provided evidence of causation, as subtle manipulations known to trigger analytic processing also encouraged religious disbelief. Combined, these studies indicate that analytic processing is one factor (presumably among several) that promotes religious disbelief. Although these findings do not speak directly to conversations about the inherent rationality, value, or truth of religious beliefs, they illuminate one cognitive factor that may influence such discussions.},

	abstract = {Social media platforms provide adolescents with unprecedented opportunities for social interactions during a critical developmental period when the brain is especially sensitive to social feedback.To explore how adolescents’ frequency of checking behaviors on social media platforms is associated with longitudinal changes in functional brain development across adolescence.A 3-year longitudinal cohort study of functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) among sixth- and seventh-grade students recruited from 3 public middle schools in rural North Carolina.At wave 1, participants reported the frequency at which they checked Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat.Neural responses to the Social Incentive Delay task when anticipating receiving social feedback, measured annually using fMRI for 3 years. Participants saw a cue that indicated whether the social feedback (adolescent faces with emotional expressions) would be a reward, punishment, or neutral; after a delay, a target appeared and students responded by pressing a button as quickly as possible; a display of social feedback depended on trial type and reaction time.Of 178 participants recruited at age 12 years, 169 participants (mean [SD] age, 12.89 [0.58] years; range, 11.93-14.52 years; 91 [53.8\%] female; 38 [22.5\%] Black, 60 [35.5\%] Latinx, 50 [29.6\%] White, 15 [8.9\%] multiracial) met the inclusion criteria. Participants with habitual social media checking behaviors showed lower neural sensitivity to social anticipation at age 12 years compared with those with nonhabitual checking behaviors in the left amygdala, posterior insula (PI), and ventral striatum (VS; β, −0.22; 95\% CI, −0.33 to −0.11), right amygdala (β, −0.19; 95\% CI, −0.30 to −0.08), right anterior insula (AI; β, −0.23; 95\% CI, −0.37 to −0.09), and left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC; β, −0.29; 95\% CI, −0.44 to −0.14). Among those with habitual checking behaviors, there were longitudinal increases in the left amygdala/PI/VS (β, 0.11; 95\% CI, 0.04 to 0.18), right amygdala (β, 0.09; 95\% CI, 0.02 to 0.16), right AI (β, 0.15; 95\% CI, 0.02 to 0.20), and left DLPFC (β, 0.19; 95\% CI, 0.05 to 0.25) during social anticipation, whereas among those with nonhabitual checking behaviors, longitudinal decreases were seen in the left amygdala/PI/VS (β, −0.12; 95\% CI, −0.19 to −0.06), right amygdala (β, −0.10; 95\% CI, −0.17 to −0.03), right AI (β, −0.13; 95\% CI, −0.22 to −0.04), and left DLPFC (β, −0.10, 95\% CI, −0.22 to −0.03).The results of this cohort study suggest that social media checking behaviors in early adolescence may be associated with changes in the brain’s sensitivity to social rewards and punishments. Further research examining long-term associations between social media use, adolescent neural development, and psychological adjustment is needed to understand the effects of a ubiquitous influence on development for today’s adolescents.},

	abstract = {The impact of the Internet across multiple aspects of modern society is clear. However, the influence that it may have on our brain structure and functioning remains a central topic of investigation. Here we draw on recent psychological, psychiatric and neuroimaging findings to examine several key hypotheses on how the Internet may be changing our cognition. Specifically, we explore how unique features of the online world may be influencing: a) attentional capacities, as the constantly evolving stream of online information encourages our divided attention across multiple media sources, at the expense of sustained concentration; b) memory processes, as this vast and ubiquitous source of online information begins to shift the way we retrieve, store, and even value knowledge; and c) social cognition, as the ability for online social settings to resemble and evoke real‐world social processes creates a new interplay between the Internet and our social lives, including our self‐concepts and self‐esteem. Overall, the available evidence indicates that the Internet can produce both acute and sustained alterations in each of these areas of cognition, which may be reflected in changes in the brain. However, an emerging priority for future research is to determine the effects of extensive online media usage on cognitive development in youth, and examine how this may differ from cognitive outcomes and brain impact of uses of Internet in the elderly. We conclude by proposing how Internet research could be integrated into broader research settings to study how this unprecedented new facet of society can affect our cognition and the brain across the life course.},

The model has two main parts that are critical to understanding the ancient positions on sacrifice. First, sacrifice is a non-discursive ritual practice that does not encode its own interpretation. This allows for a competition over the meaning and purpose of animal sacrifice. This competition was alive and well in the ancient Mediterranean. The second is the reciprocal logic of sacrifice which undergirds the majority of ancient thinkers’ understandings of this ritual. Lack of attention to these two points is responsible for the majority of modern misunderstandings of this ritual. The ancient thinkers who carried on this competition were not average persons; they were elite, highly-educated cultural producers. To understand their texts, we must understand the field of cultural competition in which they were engaged.},

Indeed, a variety of distinct cognitive mechanisms are engaged, in various combinations, in the diverse interactions called ‘rituals’ – and each of these mechanisms deserves study, in terms of its evolutionary underpinnings and cultural consequences. We identify four such mechanisms that each appear in some ‘rituals’, namely (i) the normative scripting of actions; (ii) the use of interactions to signal coalitional identity, affiliation, cohesiveness; (iii) magical claims based on intuitive expectations of contagion; and (iv) ritualized behaviour based on a specific handling of the flow of behaviour. We describe the cognitive and evolutionary background to each of these potential components of ‘rituals’, and their effects on cultural transmission.

	abstract = {The first reports on tolerance to the serotonergic hallucinogen lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) were published half a century ago, yet hitherto, a systematic review on this topic is not available. In this chapter, we discuss tolerance to LSD with regard to its psychedelic and somatic effects in humans, as well as selected behaviors in animals. In humans, mental tolerance to LSD substantially manifests 24h after its first administration and reaches a maximum by around the fourth day. Once established, tolerance cannot be overcome even if the initial dose is quadrupled. Mental tolerance to LSD generalizes to psilocybin and mescaline but not to tetrahydrocannabinol or amphetamine. As to LSD’s somatic effects, mental tolerance most reliably is accompanied by tolerance to mydriasis. Five days of abstinence is sufficient for tolerance to be reversed; symptoms of withdrawal are not encountered. In animals, LSD-induced shaking behavior, limb flicking, and hallucinogenic pausing are undermined by tolerance, too; the first-mentioned behaviors, for instance, are subject to tachyphylaxis. Mechanistically, pharmacodynamic adaptations of serotonin 5-HT2A and/or (downstream) glutamate receptors are likely to account for tolerance; a learning-related precipitation, however, has also been described. The rapid onset of mental tolerance probably is a main reason LSD generally is not taken on an everyday basis by humans. Given its rapid reversal, on the other hand, a once-per-week abuse cannot be excluded.},

	abstract = {An investigation of stillbirth and early neonatal lamb mortality was conducted in sheep flocks in Norway. Knowledge of actual causes of death are important to aid the interpretation of results obtained during studies assessing the risk factors for lamb mortality, and when tailoring preventive measures at the flock, ewe and individual lamb level. This paper reports on the postmortem findings in 270 liveborn lambs that died during the first 5 days after birth. The lambs were from 17 flocks in six counties. A total of 27\% died within 3 h after birth, 41\% within 24 h and 80\% within 2 days. Most lambs (62\%) were from triplet or higher order litters. In 81\% of twin and larger litters, only one lamb died. The most frequently identified cause of neonatal death was infectious disease (n=97, 36\%); 48\% (n=47) of these died from septicaemia, 25\% (n=24) from pneumonia, 22\% (n=21) from gastrointestinal infections and 5\% (n=5) from other infections. Escherichia coli accounted for 65\% of the septicaemic cases, and were the most common causal agent obtained from all cases of infection (41\%). In total, 14\% of neonatal deaths resulted from infection by this bacterium. Traumatic lesions were the primary cause of death in 20\% (n=53) of the lambs. A total of 46\% of these died within 3 h after birth and 66\% within 24 h. Severe congenital malformations were found in 10\% (n=27) of the lambs, whereas starvation with no concurrent lesions was the cause of death in 6\% (n=17). In 16\% (n=43) of the lambs, no specific cause of death was identified, lambs from triplet and higher order litters being overrepresented among these cases. In this study, the main causes of neonatal lamb mortality were infection and traumatic lesions. Most neonatal deaths occurred shortly after birth, suggesting that events related to lambing and the immediate post-lambing period are critical for lamb survival.},

	abstract = {Very little is known about the chalice used by Jesus of Nazareth at the Last Supper. The first Christians used a cup of blessing for the Eucharistic celebration (1Cor 10:16), which insinuates that Jesus used a ritual cup. An exegetical study of the synoptic gospels reveals that this ritual dinner was celebrated in the home of a wealthy disciple of Jesus, who would have lent him the most valuable cup of blessing owned by the family. Hence, it is unlikely that this cup was made of common and cheap materials, such as ceramic or wood. The only mention of this cup in the early centuries is due to St. John Chrysostom, who states (ca. 395 AD) that it was not made of silver. However, its veracity is not reliable due to the lack of earlier comments. In recent decades, archaeological excavations in the Holy Land have revealed that, at the time of Jesus, the use of vessels carved in limestone was common in Jerusalem for ritual practices in the domestic sphere because they were considered unsusceptible to impurity. This fact suggests that the chalice of the Last Supper might have been a valued cup of carved stone, which is consistent with the use of such bowls in the Hellenistic–Roman period among the aristocratic classes.},

Various linguistic features are analysed that are traditionally considered to be of importance in analysing linguistic variation. The traditional division of books as either Early Biblical Hebrew or Late Biblical Hebrew is hereby put to the test. Results show that RNNs are a fitting method for analysing the (morpho)syntax of a language. The model works well on both separate features, as well as all the features combined. On the basis of the results the RNNs provide, we propose that the diachronic approach to Biblical Hebrew is indeed plausible. The clusters generally hint to the scholarly division made in the diachronic approach to linguistic variation.},

	abstract = {We have developed an automated method to separate biblical texts according to author or scribal school. At the core of this new approach is the identification of correlations in word preference that are then used to quantify stylistic similarity between sections. In so doing, our method ignores literary features—such as possible repetitions, narrative breaks, and contradictions—and focuses on the least subjective criterion employed by Bible scholars to identify signs of composition. The computerized system is unique in its ability to consider subtle stylistic preferences in aggregate, whereas human scholars are generally limited to cases where a word preference is pronounced. Our method is also less liable to accusations of bias, thanks to its reliance on context-independent criteria. Its efficacy is demonstrated in its successful deconstruction of an artificial book, Jer-iel, made up of randomly interleaved snippets from Jeremiah and Ezekiel. When applied to Genesis–Numbers, the method divides the text into constituents that correlate closely with common notions of “Priestly” and “nonPriestly” material. No such corroboration is forthcoming for the classic Yahwistic/ Elohistic division.},

According to different biblical scholars, the number of letters really attributed to Paul varies from 4 to 13, with a majority agreeing on seven. This article proposes to revisit this authorship attribution problem by considering two effective methods (Burrows' Delta, Labbé's intertextual distance). Based on these results, a hierarchical clustering is then applied showing that four clusters can be derived, namely: Colossians-Ephesians, 1 and 2 Thessalonians, Titus, 1 and 2 Timothy, and Romans, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians. Moreover, a verification method based on the impostors' strategy indicates clearly that the group Colossians-Ephesians is written by the same author who seems not to be Paul. The same conclusion can be found for the cluster Titus, 1 and 2 Timothy. The Letter to Philemon stays as a singleton, without any close stylistic relationship with the other epistles. Finally, a group of four letters Romans, Galatians, 1 and 2 Corinthians is certainly written by the same author (Paul), but the verification protocol also indicates that 2 Corinthians is related to 1 Thessalonians, rendering a clear and simple interpretation difficult.},

The Pauline letters were written to churches and individuals addressing various issues in the early church and offering instructions and encouragement to the believers of his day. To understand Paul’s message as a whole, we clustered his letters, their chapters, and their verses respectively to identify the topics that are addressed repeatedly or once, offering different views at three granularities with each complementing the other. Our calculation implied all Pauline letters could be divided into six groups, well in line with the church tradition. They were First and Second Thessalonians, First and Second Corinthians, Colossians and Ephesians, Galatians and Romans, Philemon and Philippians, and First and Second Timothy and Titus. Among all letters First Corinthians had the most unique chapters, while First Corinthians and Romans had the most unique verses. Furthermore, similar verses and chapters from his letters were also discovered. We also studied the authorship of the letter to Hebrews, an anonymous letter in the New Testament. Using known Pauline and non-Pauline letters as training data, we built nine highly reliable predictors, which collectively predicted that the book of Hebrews was not authored by Paul.},

It then gives a new interpretation of Gregory's relationship to this debate. It argues, finally, that Gregory Nazianzen defines his Christology chiefly in opposition to Diodore, rather than to Apollinarius, as is commonly believed, even as he opposes them both in the end.},

Prior to my analysis of Matthew 21:7 I discuss the related question of why Matthew’s account of Jesus’ entry into Jerusalem involves two animals rather than one, arguing that the ‘history conformed to Scripture interpretation’ is more probable than the ‘Scripture conformed to history’ interpretation.

Utilizing 25 indicators, the uniquely extensive Successful Societies Scale reveals that population diversity and immigration correlate weakly with 1st world socioeconomic conditions, and high levels of income disparity, popular religiosity as measured by differing levels of belief and activity, and rejection of evolutionary science correlate strongly negatively with improving conditions. The historically unprecedented socioeconomic security that results from low levels of progressive government policies appear to suppress popular religiosity and creationist opinion, conservative religious ideology apparently contributes to societal dysfunction, and religious prosociality and charity are less effective at improving societal conditions than are secular government programs. The antagonistic relationship between better socioeconomic conditions and intense popular faith may prevent the existence of nations that combine the two factors. The nonuniversality of strong religious devotion, and the ease with which large populations abandon serious theism when conditions are sufficiently benign, refute hypotheses that religious belief and practice are the normal, deeply set human mental state, whether they are superficial or natural in nature. Instead popular religion is usually a superficial and flexible psychological mechanism for coping with the high levels of stress and anxiety produced by sufficiently dysfunctional social and especially economic environments. Popular nontheism is a similarly casual response to superior conditions.},

	abstract = {The past two decades have seen a surge of research publications in the psychology of religion, with most studies affirming the salutary effects afforded by religious functioning. However, current mental health researchers have advocated for more nuanced examinations of religious constructs and more careful analysis of potentially harmful aspects of religiosity. Particularly absent from the psychological literature are the mental health effects religious beliefs may exert on parishioners. Researchers note that this is surprising given the general psychological tenet that beliefs are inextricably bound-up with affective states and general mental health. Responding to the admonition of researchers in the field, this study proposes and tests an initial model of psycho-spiritual abuse. The proposed model of psycho-spiritual abuse hypothesizes that religious beliefs such as the theological doctrine of original sin, fundamentalist ideology, lack of self-forgiveness, and negative God-representations, in addition to familial upbringing, may negatively impact an individual’s view of self, thus fostering psychological distress. In particular, this study considers scrupulosity disorder, depression, and shame to be the primary psychiatric maladies engendered by psycho-spiritual abuse. Two hundred thirty five parishioners from 18 Christian faith groups across the United States participated in an online survey consisting of standardized measures of original sin, fundamentalism, self-forgiveness, god image, perceived parental rearing, scrupulosity, depression, and shame. A canonical correlation analysis was conducted because it allows for the simultaneously testing of the relationship between the criterion variables (i.e., scrupulosity, depression, and shame) and predictor variables (i.e., original sin, religious fundamentalism, self-forgiveness, parental rearing perceived as rejecting, emotionally warm, and overprotective, as well as accepting, presence, and challenging God-representations) of interest. Results reveal that greater degrees of belief in the theological doctrine of original sin as well as greater adherence to religious fundamentalist ideologies are directly and indirectly associated with scrupulous and depressive symptomatology as well as with shame-prone feelings and actions in unhealthy ways. Results also indicate that God-representations also play an essential role in scrupulosity, depression, and shame in hypothesized ways. Hence, such results further implicate the centrality of religious ideologies in the expression of psychopathology. Additionally, results seem to suggest that the direct familial contribution to the expression of psychopathology among parishioners appears to be weaker (i.e., secondary) than that of religious beliefs; this statement is based on the fact that perceived parental rearing practices were secondary contributors to the synthetic variable of psycho-spiritual beliefs in both Function 1 and 2. Finally, these results suggest that the primary mechanism through which religious beliefs as well as familial upbringing impact parishioner psychological well-being is the resulting view of the self they engender. Therefore, results suggest that the proposed model of psycho-spiritual abuse is sound.},

This is exacerbated by the notion that Matthew was unaware of Hebrew poetic parallelism in his allusion to Zechariah’s prophecy and portrayed Jesus as riding two donkeys. Matthew’s gospel contrasts the other three evangelists, who report only one donkey in their accounts. In this article, an exegetical analysis of Matthew 21:2 reveals grammatical and lexical considerations that clarify Matthew’s apparent divergence. It has been established that Jesus mounted a young male donkey that had never been ridden before. The final personal plural pronoun αὐτωv in Matthew 21:7, read together with the final coordinating conjunction καὶ, has been shown that it relates to the garments upon which Jesus sat, not on the two donkeys. The study also shows that when the final καί in Matthew 21:5 is read epexegetically as an adverb or ascensive conjunction and translated as “even,” the allusion to Zechariah’s prophecy proves that Matthew was aware of Hebraic poetic parallelism. The same holds for the Hebrew text in Zechariah 9:9, where the waw conjunction is considered epexegetical.},

Every term in this statement(God, exists, as or in, equally divine, Person) has been variouslyunderstood. The guiding principle has been the creedal declarationthat the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit of the New Testament areconsubstantial (i.e. the same in substance or essence, Greek:homoousios). Because this shared substance or essence is adivine one, this is understood to imply that all three namedindividuals are divine, and equally so. Yet the three in some sense“are” the one God of the Bible.},

Several attempts have been made to obtain a direct image of DNA with alternative techniques. The direct image is intended to allow a quantitative evaluation of all relevant characteristic lengths present in a molecule. A direct image of DNA, which is different from diffraction in the reciprocal space, is difficult to obtain for two main reasons: the intrinsic very low contrast of the elements that form the molecule and the difficulty of preparing the sample while preserving its pristine shape and size.

In the image, all relevant lengths of A-form DNA are measurable. A high-resolution transmission electron microscope that operates at 80 keV with an ultimate resolution of 1.5 Å was used for this experiment.

	abstract = {The Midianite-Kenite hypothesis, the idea that the pre-Israelite roots of Yahwism can be traced back to the areas south and southeast of Palestine, has a long pedigree in biblical scholarship. Analyses supporting this view generally agree in three main points. First, they assume that the influence of the southern cultic practices on Yahwism occurred during a restricted period of time, traditionally dated to the Early Iron Age. Second, they see the origins of Yahwism through the lenses of diffusionist perspectives, characterizing this process as a movement or migration of one or a few determined groups to Canaan. And third, adequate analyses of the archaeological evidence of the arid areas to the south of Palestine are few. In this article I will turn the interpretation of the epigraphic and archaeological evidence upside down. Instead of looking to the (mostly biblical) evidence on the origins of the cult of Yahweh and assuming its genesis lies in movements of people from the southern regions to Canaan in the Early Iron Age, I will focus attention on the history of the cultic practices in the Negev, southern Transjordan, and northern Hejaz during the entire Iron Age, and how this information is related to the religious practices known in Judah and Israel during the biblical period, shedding new light on the prehistory of the cult of Yahweh. I will evaluate the evidence not as a single, exceptional event, but as a long-term process within the several-millennia history of cultic practices and beliefs of the local peoples.},

The link from people's ideology to their opinions is assumed to go via a semantic processing of moral arguments that relies on the individual's cognitive ability. An implication of this model is that the relative quality of arguments that justify supporting vs. opposing a moral policy—the policy's “argument advantage”—is key to how opinions will be distributed in the population and develop over time. To test this implication, we combine polling data with measures of the argument advantage for 35 moral policies. Consistent with the opinion formation model, the argument advantage of a moral policy accounts for how public opinion moves over time, and how support for the policy ideologies varies across different ideological groups and levels of cognitive ability, including a strong interaction between ideology and cognitive ability.},

To explore the characteristics of these children, we reinterviewed and administered a battery of tasks to 61 children (ages 4–9years) who had previously participated in an eyewitness study where a man broke a “germ rule” twice when he tried to touch them. Performance on utilization, response conflict (Luria tapping), and theory of mind tasks predicted the number of false reports of touching (with age and time since the event controlled) and correctly classified 90.16\% of the children as typical witnesses or exuberant (more than 3) false reporters. Results of a factor analysis pointed to a common process underlying performance on these tasks that accounted for 49\% of the variability in false reports. Relations between task performance and testimony confirmed that the mechanisms underlying occasional intrusions are different from those that drive persistent confabulation and that deficient cognitive control fuels young children’s exuberant false reports.},

To prime Black or White race, participants wrote a paragraph about a student with a typical Black or White name. They then read editorials that accused Obama of being unpatriotic or being the Anti-Christ, or that listed his positions on major issues. Participants responded to both criticisms with diminished preferences for and more negative beliefs about Obama, but only when African–American race was primed. Interestingly, the Anti-Christ criticism increased preferences and positive beliefs about Obama in the absence of racial priming, suggesting this criticism may have lacked credibility under neutral conditions.

The dominant critical consensus since the late nineteenth century holds that Israel’s faith evolved from polytheism or henotheism to monotheism. Passages in the Hebrew Bible that assume the existence of other gods are compared to other passages that put forth the declaration that “there are no other gods besides” the God of Israel as proof of this view. Other scholars who reject this evolutionary paradigm tend to assume passages evincing divine plurality actually speak of human beings, or that the other gods are merely idols. This view insists that “monotheism” must mean that the existence of other gods is denied. Both views are problematic and fall short of doing justice to the full description of Israel’s view of God and the heavenly host in the Hebrew Bible.

Surveying fundamentalist movements in Christianity, Judaism, Islam, Hinduism, Sikhism, and Buddhism, the contributors describe the organization of such movements, their leadership and recruitment techniques, and the ways in which their ideological programs and organizational structures shift in response to social and political changes.

It is therefore no surprise that the premier apocalyptic theologian of the New Testament would spawn several apocalyptic imitators. Two 'Apocalypses of Paul' have come down to us from antiquity, one gnostic, the other Christian. After discussing each work, the article asks to what extent the historical Paul would have agreed with these later works written in his name.

	abstract = {This study focuses on the material context of medieval charms by investigating how books differ from rolls as carriers of charms. The essential difference between medieval books and rolls as carriers of charms appears to lie in the kind of unity they constitute. A roll featuring charms like the one described in the present work was probably used integrally as a physical protective device, making it the epitome of a functional unity: the whole of its contents combined with the physical writing surface of the roll itself is what defines the use of the roll. A book can certainly also make up a thematic unity, but the functional combination of contents and materiality is not as strongly present. Instead, books containing charms were more likely to have functioned as storehouses of information in a less physical sense. The texts, including the charms, could be consulted separately, and were also more likely to be perceived as such. This would explain why added and deleted texts are more commonly found in books than on rolls. The intensity of the usage of rolls, especially amulet rolls that were worn on the body, could be one of the reasons why relatively few medieval rolls survive. Ultimately, it was not the carrier that selected the charm, nor was it the charm that selected the carrier. It was an individual’s purpose that determined whether and how a charm was to become part of the contents of a particular material carrier.},

	abstract = {The proliferation of fake news on social media platforms has become a significant concern, influencing public opinion, political decisions, and societal trust. While much research has focused on the technological and algorithmic factors behind the spread of misinformation, less attention has been given to the psychological drivers that contribute to the creation and dissemination of fake news. Cognitive biases, emotional appeals, and social identity motivations are believed to play a crucial role in shaping user behaviour on social media, yet there is limited systematic understanding of how these psychological factors intersect with online information sharing. Existing studies tend to focus on individual aspects of fake news consumption, such as susceptibility to misinformation or partisan biases, leaving a gap in understanding the broader psychological mechanisms behind both the creation and dissemination of fake news. This systematic review aims to fill this gap by synthesizing current research on the psychological factors that influence social media users’ involvement in dissemination and creation of fake news. Twenty-three studies were identified from 2014 to 2024 following the PRISMA guidelines. We have identified five themes through critical review and synthesis of the literature which are personal factors, ignorance, social factors, biological process, and cognitive process. These themes help to explain the psychological factors contributing to the creation and dissemination of fake news among social media users. Based on the findings, it is evident that diverse psychological factors influence the dissemination and creation of fake news, which must be studied to design better strategies to minimize this issue.},

	abstract = {The Sunday Letter in its Anglo-Saxon context represents some of the earliest evidence for its widespread use in the West. Six copies survive, representing four distinct lines of transmission. If it is remarkable that we encounter the letter so often in Old English, it is even more striking that it appears to have been acceptable in a variety of environments. The most learned minds of the age may have rejected it, but its placement in manuscripts compiled at respected centres and the evidence of active use suggest that it was found to be a suitable vehicle for instruction in certain contexts.ManuscriptsCambridge, Corpus Christi College 140 (Letter A)Letter A was copied into CCCC 140, a West Saxon version of the Gospels written at Bath Abbey in the first half of the eleventh century. The Sunday Letter was added later (s. xi) at the end of the Gospel of Mark and is written in the same hand as some of the manumissions added at Bath in the blank spaces of the manuscript; all of these mention Abbot Ælfsige (1075–87), which provides a convenient way to assign a defined time period to the work of the scribe.The text follows the end of Mark without a break and with an only slightly enlarged capital h. The scribe edited (perhaps for oral delivery) the first line, adding an introductory Men þa leofestan, halie before gewrit and soðlice to the beginning of the second sentence. The placement of this Sunday Letter is remarkable.The addition of non-canonical text to books of scripture is not unique, but the Sunday Letter is a very unconventional text, raising the unanswerable question of whether the writer placed it in this context simply because the empty space was available, or because he in fact thought that the letter had near-canonical status, since it does, after all, claim to have been written by the Saviour's own hand (þurh þæs hehstan hælendes handa gewriten). In other Old English versions of the Sunday Letter, the text is called a godspell, though not in this particular one; however, as mentioned above, halie is supplied before gewrit, possibly in an effort to add some authority to the piece.},

In Epistolary Acts, Jordan Zweck examines the presentation of letters in early medieval vernacular literature, including hagiography, prose romance, poetry, and sermons on letters from heaven, moving beyond traditional genre study to offer a radically new way of conceptualizing Anglo-Saxon epistolarity. Zweck argues that what makes early medieval English epistolarity unique is the performance of what she calls “epistolary acts,” the moments when authors represent or embed letters within vernacular texts. The book contributes to a growing interest in the intersections between medieval studies and media studies, blending traditional book history and manuscript studies with affect theory, media studies, and archive studies.},

	abstract = {The present article suggests that Deuteronomy 32:8-9 and 43 (which were preserved in their original form in the Septuagint and at Qumran, and allow for the existence of deities besides YHWH), belong to an ancient hymn used by the later author who composed the Song of Moses. This hymn, it is proposed, may be compared with the Mesopotamian exaltation songs, and in particular with two Babylonian texts about Ishtar known as 'The Hymn to The Queen of Nippur' and 'The Exaltation of Ishtar'. According to 'The Exaltation of Ishtar', when the main deities (Anu, Ea, and Enlil) apportioned to the inferior gods their cosmic tasks, Ishtar was exalted above them; she became equal to Anu, Ea, and Enlil, and was given a place in the central temples of the main deities. In light of this sequence, it seems probable that the original purpose of the allotment of portions in Deut 32:8-9 was to stress that YHWH (probably identified as one of the sons of El) was exalted to the status of the main God to rule over the minor deities, the sons of El; as part of his new status he was given a special possession — Israel. The natural continuation of those verses probably was verse 43, which concluded with the minor deities recognizing YHWH's (new) status and paying homage to him. Despite the fact that it contained traces of polytheistic beliefs, this ancient hymn, which was most likely well known, was used by the author of the Song of Moses, which emphatically denies the existence of all deities but YHWH, to stress the special status of Israel and its unique relation to YHWH, the only God.},

This reading would have been abbreviated into a text-form of the type attested in the Septuagint and {\textless}tex-math{\textgreater}\$4{\textbackslash}text\{QDeut\}{\textasciicircum}\{{\textbackslash}text\{j\}\}\${\textless}/tex-math{\textgreater} , by omission of the problematic word "bull". The conjecture would also account for the Masoretic reading, "to the number of the sons of Israel". Supportive evidence for the reading is found in Ugaritic texts and in Hos. viii 6.},
