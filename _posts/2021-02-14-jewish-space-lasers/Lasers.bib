About 50 W output power has been obtained with slope efficiency of 67\%.

Pulse energy as high as 600 mJ is demonstrated at 1064 nm, with a super-Gaussian spatial profile and beam quality as good as 1.6 times the diffraction limit. A time-dependent pulse amplification model is developed and is in general agreement with experimentally measured values of output pulse energy and temporal pulse shape of the amplified pulses. Key performance parameters (pulse energy, temporal pulse shape, and spatial beam profile and quality) are analyzed as a function of pulse width across seven orders of magnitude. Additionally, the model is used to elucidate deviations between the simulated and experimental data, showing that the relationship between pulse width and output pulse energy is dominated by the variable-pulse-width oscillator performance, not the burst-mode amplifier.},

	abstract = {Directed energy propulsion for interstellar travel has been proposed as an ideal method for reaching appreciable speeds relative to the speed of light: 0.2c. However, the amount of energy required necessitates a large aperture, on the order of kilometers, while mitigation of atmospheric perturbations requires a discretization of the aperture into many individual laser elements. The use of fiber lasers for these elements obligates mode-matching the fiber to the desired 10 cm aperture for a collimated beam. Various collimation systems were designed and compared. A 3-lens system with one achromat and two aspheric lenses, with two of the lenses used as a Keplerian telescope to achieve a system-shortening effect was analyzed. A similar system made with a plano-convex lens replacing the large-aperture aspheric lens with two additional compensating lenses was compared. A single diffractive optic operating at F/8 was likewise considered. The optical performance of these systems was compared, as was the cost-effectiveness. Scalability to millions of elements was required, so cost-per-system was a crucial consideration factor. Possible manufacturing processes for a diffractive system were investigated, and stamping processes for replication were analyzed to determine the possibility of replication of such an optic reliably, cheaply, and with acceptable results.},

	abstract = {An experimental study of horizontal laser beam propagation over paths up to 145 km long was made in which beam diameter and shape, intensity fluctuations, and optical phase distortion were measured. It was found that (1) received beam diameter decreases (on-axis power density increases) with increasing transmitter aperture to a limit reached at an aperture of about 11 cm, (2) beam diameter varies as the 1.2 power of path length, (3) the amplitude of intensity fluctuations decreases with increasing receiver aperture and is nearly independent of path length for paths longer than 0.55 km, (4) the fluctuation spectrum shows a decrease in spectral power with increasing frequency, this negative slope becoming steeper with increasing receiver aperture and remaining constant with path length, and (5) rms fluctuation in phase path length was observed to be 0.25 micro over a 48.8-m path. In addition, it is shown that geometrical optics based on the effects of large scale atmospheric irregularities does not adequately account for signal intensity fluctuations. These results may be helpful in predicting the capability of specific communications systems and in understanding better the nature of atmospheric turbulence.},

	doi = {10.1109/PROC.1977.10809},
	abstract = {This paper presents a tutorial review of the self-induced thermal distortion of laser radiation propagating in absorbing media. The distortion of the laser beam is the result of heating of the path by absorption of a small fraction of the laser beam power by the medium which changes the index of refraction and therefore distorts the beam. Thermal-blooming effects can limit the laser powers which can be effectively propagated through the atmosphere, or in media which absorb laser power such as industrial or laboratory environments, liquid or gas cells, or even laser active media themselves. In this paper, we review the steady-state thermal blooming of CW beams including laboratory-simulation experiments and computer-code results. The thermal distortion of pulsed-laser radiation is also covered including single-pulse thermal distortion and the distortion of a train of laser pulses. In these discussions, we derive and identify the scaling laws and determine the important nondimensional parameters so that the results can be interpreted and applied to other propagation conditions. The thermal-blooming problem can be complicated by a number of circumstances, such as the geometry of the propagation path, and these special cases are also reviewed. Among those covered are: the influence of stagnation zones, transonic flow, the kinetic cooling effect, molecular and aerosol absorption and relaxation, laser-beam jitter, and atmospheric turbulence. In addition, the techniques utilized to minimize blooming, such as laser-beam shaping, and adaptive-optics phase correction, are also discussed.},
