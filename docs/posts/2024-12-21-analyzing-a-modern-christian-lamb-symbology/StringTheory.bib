Individual searches in the channels H-{\textgreater}ZZ{\textasciicircum}(*)-{\textgreater}llll, H-{\textgreater}gamma gamma and H-{\textgreater}WW-{\textgreater}e nu mu nu in the 8 TeV data are combined with previously published results of searches for H-{\textgreater}ZZ{\textasciicircum}(*), WW{\textasciicircum}(*), bbbar and tau{\textasciicircum}+tau{\textasciicircum}- in the 7 TeV data and results from improved analyses of the H-{\textgreater}ZZ{\textasciicircum}(*)-{\textgreater}llll and H-{\textgreater}gamma gamma channels in the 7 TeV data. Clear evidence for the production of a neutral boson with a measured mass of 126.0 +/- 0.4(stat) +/- 0.4(sys) GeV is presented. This observation, which has a significance of 5.9 standard deviations, corresponding to a background fluctuation probability of 1.7x10{\textasciicircum}-9, is compatible with the production and decay of the Standard Model Higgs boson.},

	abstract = {In the Song of Moses, the verses of Deut. 32:8-9 point to an ancient division among the nations, that created a unique bond between God and Israel. In this article we wish to trace an early understanding of these verses in Second Temple and Rabbinic literature as intended to establish Israel's right to the Land of Israel, even though the Land of Israel is not mentioned in the song. On the basis of sources from the Ancient Near East and Greek literature it is possible to infer that the Song of Moses included a territorial aspect from the beginning. However, this aspect became more central and concrete after the Babylonian Exile, and especially once the version 'the sons of Israel' was introduced to replace 'the sons of God'. One can discern two main exegetical trajectories that identified the event in these verses as the inheritance of the Land of Israel. According to the first, these verses allude to the myth of the division of the world by Noah among his three sons, which was inspired by an earlier myth of the tripartite division of the cosmos among the gods. Noah's division allotted the Land of Israel to Israel even before their existence as a nation. According to the second trajectory, which seems to be based on the identification of 'the sons of Israel' with 'the sons of God', the verses describe the inheritance of the Land of God by the sons of God. That is, the conquering of the land by Israel and the expulsion of the sinful nations living there. The exegetical efforts to anchor in these verses foundational myths concerning the inheritance of the Land of Israel highlight the central position these verses held in the eyes of various writers in antiquity.},

	abstract = {The present article suggests that Deuteronomy 32:8-9 and 43 (which were preserved in their original form in the Septuagint and at Qumran, and allow for the existence of deities besides YHWH), belong to an ancient hymn used by the later author who composed the Song of Moses. This hymn, it is proposed, may be compared with the Mesopotamian exaltation songs, and in particular with two Babylonian texts about Ishtar known as 'The Hymn to The Queen of Nippur' and 'The Exaltation of Ishtar'. According to 'The Exaltation of Ishtar', when the main deities (Anu, Ea, and Enlil) apportioned to the inferior gods their cosmic tasks, Ishtar was exalted above them; she became equal to Anu, Ea, and Enlil, and was given a place in the central temples of the main deities. In light of this sequence, it seems probable that the original purpose of the allotment of portions in Deut 32:8-9 was to stress that YHWH (probably identified as one of the sons of El) was exalted to the status of the main God to rule over the minor deities, the sons of El; as part of his new status he was given a special possession — Israel. The natural continuation of those verses probably was verse 43, which concluded with the minor deities recognizing YHWH's (new) status and paying homage to him. Despite the fact that it contained traces of polytheistic beliefs, this ancient hymn, which was most likely well known, was used by the author of the Song of Moses, which emphatically denies the existence of all deities but YHWH, to stress the special status of Israel and its unique relation to YHWH, the only God.},
