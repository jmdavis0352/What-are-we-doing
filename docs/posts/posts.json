    "description": "The practice of symbolizing Jesus as the paschal lamb or associating him with other Jewish Temple elements is evident in our earliest manuscript evidence from Christianity (the authentic Pauline epistles, mostly written in the 50's CE). Just as Christology and eschatology evolve over the centuries to address theological or dogmatic problems, this symbolism similarly evolves as Christian writers innovate to inject renewed interest and, more recently, to get subscribers, views, shares, likes, and clicks - the better to spread the good news with. Here we examine one such modern symbological narrative to study how these innovations originate.",

    "contents": "\r\nThe Lamb Symbology Narrative in Question\r\nHere we have the version of this narrative that is the focus of our\r\nstudy today. A friend shared it on social media with the imperative,\r\n‚ÄúBecause I care‚Ä¶Ponder on this my dears‚Äù:\r\n\r\nNo matter how many times I read this, I just cannot do it without\r\ngetting chills all over me! üò≤ I bet you didn‚Äôt know the following\r\nabout the manger that Jesus was laid in. Of course mangers are animal\r\nfeeding troughs but in ancient Israel they were made of stone - not\r\nwhat you would see in a modern day nativity scene1. Not\r\ncomfortable, but great for protection. That‚Äôs why those who were\r\nexperts in this matter, the priests, would put their newborn lambs in\r\nthem for protection. But not just any lamb, the unblemished perfect\r\nlambs that were used in the sacrifice for sins. And Bethlehem, where\r\nJesus was born was FAMOUS for their UNBLEMISHED LAMBS used for the\r\nsacrifice. These lambs had to be perfect so they would wrap them\r\ntightly in cloth and lie them in the manger to keep them safe. This is\r\nexactly why the only time mangers are mentioned in Jesus‚Äô birth story\r\nit is being told to shepherds. In Luke 2 it says ‚ÄúThis will be a sign\r\nfor you, you will find a baby wrapped in cloth and lying in a manger.‚Äù\r\nThe shepherds would have understood this powerful parallel! THEY KNEW\r\nwhat the cloth and the manger meant! This baby would be THE PERFECT\r\nLAMB OF GOD! The Messiah who would sacrifice His life for the sins of\r\nthe whole world. He wasn‚Äôt just a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes\r\nlying in a manger, He was GOD: perfect, sinless and Holy, humbling\r\nHimself to become the perfect sacrifice to reconcile us back to\r\nHimself!! THAT my friend, that Perfect Lamb, is WHY we celebrate\r\nChristmas!!\r\n\r\nI pondered it for a few minutes, then left it alone. I went back and\r\npondered it a little more, then studied it for an hour or so. After\r\npondering the result of that hour long study, and particularly because\r\nof the qualifying clause of the imperative to ponder (‚ÄúBecause I care‚Äù)\r\n‚Äì I decided to study it rigorously and to formally document that study.\r\nI‚Äôm writing this very much because I share that sentiment of caring. I\r\ncare about the world we live in, about educating ourselves to discover\r\nthe nature of the universe, about how we author the rules of civil\r\nsociety, and fundamental to all of these concerns, I care about\r\nconstructing our world views from reasoning that is logically valid and\r\npremises that are true. The ascertainment of truth however, is difficult\r\nand time consuming.\r\nResults of Superficial Pondering\r\nThe first time I read the narrative my initial impression was that it\r\nwas fabricated (like the stories in chain emails where my friend found\r\nthis letter in a Vietnam Vet‚Äôs closet after he died that comments\r\npoignantly on a phenomenon strongly resembling a recent political\r\nevent). This initial impression stemmed from the use of two rhetorical\r\ndevices employed in the first two sentences that are common in\r\nfabricated stories crafted with to attract attention and promote rapid\r\ntransmission:\r\nThe first sentence is an assertion that the content is so compelling\r\nit causes a physical reaction to which one is never inured\r\nregardless of the total number of exposures ‚Äì this is an accurate\r\ndescription of the physiological response to an addictive substance\r\nto which humans do not develop a tolerance.2 The intent of this\r\nsentence is to assure the reader that something unimaginably\r\npowerful must lie waiting in the following paragraph ‚Äì what could\r\nit possibly be? we are meant to ask ourselves.\r\nThe second sentence is a confident assertion that that the reader\r\nhas never heard the content to follow, through the specific phrase\r\n‚ÄúI bet you didn‚Äôt know‚Ä¶‚Äù ‚Äì this is a rhetorical device to engage\r\naudiences by accusing them of ignorance ‚Äì the most common and\r\nimmediate reaction to such assertions is a defensive desire to\r\ndemonstrate the accuser to be incorrect ‚Äì how can we ascertain that\r\nthe author who asserts we don‚Äôt know is wrong? by reading what\r\nfollows to see if we have in fact heard of it of course ‚Äì which is\r\nthe desired effect of the accusation.\r\nNo human just sharing information they discovered writes this way ‚Äì\r\nthese are hallmarks of intentionally crafted narrative and in my\r\nexperience, are almost always followed by marketing material, fiction,\r\nor fraud. Alone however, these devices don‚Äôt provide any data regarding\r\nthe value or nature of whatever follows ‚Äì but they do make me\r\nsuspicious. The second time I pondered, I pondered with an elevated\r\nlevel of critical thought.\r\nResults of More Critical Pondering and some Mild Googling\r\nEvaluating content critically is difficult. It requires focus, energy, and an\r\nactive application of all of our knowledge and faculties to examine\r\nclaims and arguments on their own merits. It takes time, work, and care.\r\nI hypothesize that when we consume media, particularly on social media,\r\nwe are frequently not thinking critically. Munusamy et al. (2024)\r\nconduct a meta analysis of 23 studies examining disinformation\r\npropagation on social media and assert ‚ÄúThere is a lower likelihood\r\nthat social media users will research the content they read or post.‚Äù I\r\nthink this may simply be because we are busy and tired, and when\r\nscrolling memes and posts, we‚Äôre mostly there for the low effort\r\ndopamine reward (see (Firth et al. 2019), (Maza et al. 2023)). If\r\nconsuming social media non-critically is a typical behavior, this may be\r\none reason why Butler (2024) reports data indicating social\r\nmedia as a common vector for misinformation propagation and highlights\r\nthe importance of critically consuming information on such platforms.\r\nMunusamy et al. (2024) similarly concludes that because social\r\nmedia users are less likely to research content they encounter, ‚ÄúAny\r\nunconfirmed content can therefore be swiftly shared and distributed over\r\nsocial media platforms‚Äù. This phenomenon is a serious societal problem.\r\nThe subsections below document my critical analysis of the text of the\r\nlamb symbology narrative. Several components are problematic or seem\r\nimplausible to me. These elements motivated a more rigorous study.\r\nMangers for Protection?\r\nThe narrative seems3 to be correct that water or feeding troughs in\r\n1st century Palestine were commonly made from limestone, which\r\napparently means these troughs are\r\n\r\nNot comfortable, but great for protection.\r\n\r\nAre they really? The suggestion that a stone trough offers protection to\r\na lamb sitting on top of it, bound tightly in cloth, doesn‚Äôt seem\r\nplausible.\r\nHow does the stone trough provide protection? protection from\r\nwhat?\r\nRecalling the specific reason the lambs needed protection in the\r\nnarrative, it was because these were:\r\n\r\n‚Ä¶not just any lamb, the unblemished perfect lambs that were used in\r\nthe sacrifice for sins‚Ä¶These lambs had to be perfect so they would\r\nwrap them tightly in cloth and lie them in the manger to keep them\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nWhat are these blemishes that disqualify the animal for ritual\r\nslaughter?\r\nThis language certainly refers to the requirements in the Pentateuch\r\nthat the animals used in most sacrifices be ‚Äúunblemished‚Äù. But what does\r\n‚Äúunblemished‚Äù actually mean in the context of 1st Century BCE temple\r\nsacrifice in Judaism?\r\nThe authors of the Hebrew Bible don‚Äôt provide too much detail but\r\nrelevant verses with specific sections highlighted are below:\r\nExodus 12:5-13 (NRSVU)\r\n\r\n5 Your lamb shall be without blemish, a year-old male; you may take\r\nit from the sheep or from the goats. 6 You shall keep it until the\r\nfourteenth day of this month; then the whole assembled congregation of\r\nIsrael shall slaughter it at twilight. 7 They shall take some of the\r\nblood and put it on the two doorposts and the lintel of the houses in\r\nwhich they eat it. 8 They shall eat the lamb that same night; they\r\nshall eat it roasted over the fire with unleavened bread and bitter\r\nherbs. 9 Do not eat any of it raw or boiled in water but roasted over\r\nthe fire, with its head, legs, and inner organs. 10 You shall let none\r\nof it remain until the morning; anything that remains until the\r\nmorning you shall burn with fire. 11 This is how you shall eat it:\r\nyour loins girded, your sandals on your feet, and your staff in your\r\nhand, and you shall eat it hurriedly. It is the Passover of the Lord.\r\n12 I will pass through the land of Egypt that night, and I will strike\r\ndown every firstborn in the land of Egypt, from human to animal, and\r\non all the gods4 of Egypt I will execute judgments: I am the Lord.\r\n13 The blood shall be a sign for you on the houses where you live:\r\nwhen I see the blood, I will pass over you, and no plague shall\r\ndestroy you when I strike the land of Egypt.\r\n\r\nLeviticus 22:21-25 (NRSVU)\r\n\r\n21 When anyone offers a sacrifice of well-being to the Lord, in\r\nfulfillment of a vow or as a freewill offering, from the herd or from\r\nthe flock, to be acceptable it must be perfect; there shall be no\r\nblemish in it. 22 Anything blind or injured or maimed or having a\r\ndischarge or an itch or scabs‚Äîthese you shall not offer to the Lord\r\nor put any of them on the altar as offerings by fire to the Lord. 23\r\nAn ox or a lamb that is deformed or stunted you may present for a\r\nfreewill offering, but it will not be accepted for a vow. 24 Any\r\nanimal that has its testicles bruised or crushed or torn or cut, you\r\nshall not offer to the Lord; such you shall not do within your land,\r\n25 nor shall you accept any such animals from a foreigner to offer as\r\nfood5 to your God; since they are mutilated, with a blemish in\r\nthem, they shall not be accepted on your behalf.\r\n\r\nDeuteronomy 17:1 (NRSVU)\r\n\r\nYou must not sacrifice to the Lord your God an ox or a sheep that has\r\na defect, anything seriously wrong, for that is abhorrent to the Lord\r\nyour God.\r\n\r\nThe passage in Leviticus provides the most detail. Of all of these\r\nblemishes, only the injury/maiming variety could possibly be prevented\r\nby any kind of physical precautions ‚Äì the ‚Äúitch or scabs‚Äù requirement\r\nrefers to skin diseases. Commentary on the Hebrew from the Jewish\r\nVirtual Library indicates ‚Äúinjured or maimed‚Äù (Hebrew ◊©÷∏◊Å◊ë÷∑◊®\r\n[shah-VAHR]: break shatter or destroy, or ◊ó÷∏◊®÷£◊ï÷º◊• [harus]: maimed\r\nor broken) means ‚Äúbroken or cracked limbs that cause the animal to be\r\nlame‚Äù6.\r\nDifferent translations similarly indicate this meaning. The New American\r\nStandard Bible proposes:\r\n\r\nThose that are blind, fractured, maimed, or have a wart, a festering\r\nrash, or scabs, you shall not offer to the LORD\r\n\r\nas the English for Leviticus 22:22. Other translations use ‚Äúbroken or\r\nmaimed‚Äù (KJV), ‚Äúdisabled or mutilated‚Äù (ESV), ‚Äúcrippled or injured‚Äù\r\n(CSB). Given all of the above I think it‚Äôs reasonable to interpret\r\n‚Äúinjury‚Äù as something serious ‚Äì a significant sprain or fracture that\r\nmakes the animal lame in some way. The Mishnah is a later source (we\r\nwill revisit the Mishnah below) and it expounds on the definition of\r\nblemishes but doesn‚Äôt mention physical injury at all (see the Mishnah\r\ntext on blemishes\r\nhere).\r\nBased on the definition of ‚Äúblemish‚Äù in the context of animals slated\r\nfor ritual slaughter, I don‚Äôt think swaddling them in a manger would\r\nprovide any protective benefit from such defects.\r\nAn image search reveals many pictures of these troughs, and suggests\r\nheights from the ground between 12 - 24 inches and basins maybe 4-8\r\ninches deep, all open from the top. Unless the 1st Century CE shepherds\r\nneeded to protect the lambs from vertically oriented Improvised\r\nExplosive Devices7, I‚Äôm not sure how they offer protection against\r\nbecoming fractured or maimed. Common threats to lambs capable of\r\ninflicting physical harm would include local predators (canines, hyenas,\r\nbirds etc.)‚Ä¶‚Ä¶and I can‚Äôt really think of anything else ‚Äì a lamb\r\nwouldn‚Äôt be physically damaged from stumbling and falling ‚Äì maybe some\r\naccidents could occur where lambs would be trampled by larger animals ‚Äì\r\nbut for the most common threats that come to mind - I don‚Äôt see how\r\nimmobilizing a lamb in a stone trough provides a protective benefit.\r\nOther options would be better: an enclosed room or pen for instance.\r\nThe Priests are the Shepherds?\r\nThe narrative suggest that priests are the ‚Äúexperts in this matter‚Äù and\r\nthough it‚Äôs not precisely clear which matter that is, the following\r\nsentences suggest the priests are the ones raising the lambs. This seems\r\nodd to me. Before studying this narrative I had a rudimentary knowledge\r\nof the priestly order in pre-Christian Judaism, but have never heard any\r\nsuggestion that the Levite priests raised their own special flocks\r\nspecifically for ritual slaughter. I wonder where this information came\r\nfrom. There are no passages in the Bible suggesting that the priestly\r\norder functioned as shepherds that I was able to find.\r\nBethleham is FAMOUS for Unblemished lambs?\r\nThis sentence suggests invention to me. Would there really be a place\r\nthat produced especially good lambs for sacrificing? so much so that\r\neveryone would have known and it would be FAMOUS?\r\nWhen there was no mass communication? When most people in 1st Century CE\r\nPalestine were illiterate8 and would have to hear it word-of-mouth?\r\nBy the first century CE sacrifices and worship were well centralized at\r\nthe Temple in Jerusalem9 ‚Äì so most animals for sacrifice would have\r\ncome from around Jerusalem anyway (the animals being sold in the temple\r\nwhen Jesus disrupts the sellers were animals being sold as sacrifices to\r\nJews who came to offer sacrifices; the money changers were converting\r\ncurrency to pay the temple tax ‚Äì see (Seeley 1993),\r\n(McGrath n.d.))\r\nThis doesn‚Äôt seem likely to me.\r\nThe Results of Study\r\nThe concerns expressed above motivated a rigorous study seeking to\r\nevaluate the origin and veracity of the narrative. In this section I\r\nsummarize the results of Biblical scholar Wave Nunnally who has written\r\na detailed analysis tracing the origins of this narrative ‚Äì apparently\r\nidentified as the ‚ÄúNew Birth Narrative‚Äù (NBN). Nunnally is Professor\r\nEmeritus of Early Judaism and Christian Origins at Evangel University,\r\nSpringfield, MO.10\r\nThis section further includes tangential studies on topics motivated by\r\nthe examination of this narrative.\r\nTracing the Origins of the Narrative\r\nAs with most every topic of inquiry a normal human (i.e.¬†anyone who\r\nisn‚Äôt an expert on the leading edge of their field) may explore ‚Äì the\r\nveracity of this particular narrative has already been well examined by\r\nothers who are more qualified and knowledgeable than myself. The most\r\nwell supported discussions I found are from Chad Bird11 writing at\r\n1517.org (Bird 2021) and Dr.¬†Wave Nunnally writing on his own\r\nwebsite (Nunally 2023).\r\nI encourage anyone reading this to read both of those discussions in\r\nfull, but I will summarize the results of Nunally‚Äôs analysis here along\r\nwith my own thoughts.\r\nNunnally traces the most recent incarnations of the NBN ‚Äì the narrative\r\nI‚Äôm examining at the beginning of this document ‚Äì to a 2012 book titled\r\nJesus: a Theography by Frank Viola and Dr.¬†Leonard Sweet12 . The\r\nfundamental premises in this 2012 book almost certainly originate in an\r\n1883 work by Alfred Edersheim titled The Life and Times of Jesus the\r\nMessiah. Prior to 1883 the notion that priestly shepherds raised\r\nlambs for sacrifice in Bethlehem did not exist in human thought.13\r\nEdersheim (1883) writes\r\n\r\nThat the Messiah was to be born in Bethlehem, was a settled\r\nconviction14. Equally so was the belief, that He was to be revealed\r\nfrom Migdal Eder, ‚Äúthe tower of the flock‚Äù.15 This Migdal Eder was\r\nnot the watchtower for the ordinary flocks which pastured on the\r\nbarren sheep-ground beyond Bethlehem, but lay close to town, on the\r\nroad to Jerusalem. A passage in the Mishnah leads to the conclusion\r\nthat the flocks which pastured there, were destined for\r\nTemple-sacrifices, and accordingly, that the shepherds, who watched\r\nover them, were not ordinary shepherds‚Ä¶ [emphasis mine, Edersheim\r\nargues here that raising flocks was banned in this area, so if flocks\r\nwere being raised, they must be special flocks raised by priests ‚Äì\r\nSee Nunnally‚Äôs detailed review of the Mishnah and other sources\r\nEdersheim points to for reasons why this is not the case ‚Äì Edersheim\r\nchooses a particular passage but ignores several others that clarify\r\nshepherding was allowed outside urban centers]‚Ä¶ Thus, Jewish\r\ntradition in some dim manner apprehended the first revelation of the\r\nMessiah from that Migdal Eder, where shepherds watched the\r\nTemple-flocks all the year round. Of the deep symbolic significance of\r\nsuch a coincidence, it is needless to speak.\r\n\r\nSo what is the Mishnah?\r\nIt is rabbinic literature that dates to the 2nd Century CE,\r\ntwo-hundred years after the estimated date of Jesus‚Äô birth. The temple\r\nin Jerusalem was destroyed by the Roman‚Äôs in 70 CE and temple sacrifices\r\nno longer occurred, so as Dr.¬†Dan McClellan16 notes in his analysis\r\nof the this same NBN (https://youtu.be/U00gZq7s2VA?t=31), ‚Äú‚Ä¶nobody\r\nwho had anything to do with the Mishnah had ever seen a temple sacrifice\r\nor knew the circumstances regarding where the temple got their\r\nsacrifices from around the end of the 1st Century BCE and the beginning\r\nof the 1st Century CE so again, there are no data that support this\r\nclaim.‚Äù\r\nBut let‚Äôs see for ourselves ‚Äì Edersheim‚Äôs actual text (URL is linked in\r\nthe reference at the bottom of this document) includes a footnote\r\nindicating this Mishnah passage is Shekalim 7:4, so what does it\r\nactually say? We can read it\r\nhere\r\n\r\nIf an animal that is fit for the altar was found straying, from\r\nJerusalem and as far as Migdal Eder, and similarly if it was found\r\nwithin that distance from Jerusalem in any other direction, it is\r\npresumed that the animal came from Jerusalem. Most of the animals in\r\nJerusalem were designated for offerings, and presumably this one was\r\nas well. Males are presumed to be burnt-offerings, as only males are\r\nbrought as burnt-offerings. Females are presumed to be\r\npeace-offerings, as it is permitted to bring a female peace-offering.\r\nRabbi Yehuda says: An animal that is fit for the Paschal offering,\r\ni.e., a one-year-old male lamb or kid, is presumed to be a Paschal\r\noffering, provided that it was found within thirty days before the\r\nFestival of Passover. ‚Äì Mishnah, Shekalim 7:4\r\n\r\nTwo immediate observations emerge:\r\nShekalim 7:4 doesn‚Äôt say anything about flocks being raised or\r\nmanaged in Bethlehem, or in Migdal Eder. This text clearly\r\nasserts that if the animals are found there or anywhere in any\r\ndirection as far as Migdal Eder, that it‚Äôs reasonable to assume\r\nthey came from Jerusalem. The sense of the word for found is that\r\nthe animal was previously lost ‚Äì unattended, unclaimed. The only\r\nreason Migdal Eder seems to be mentioned is as a landmark for\r\ndistance from Jerusalem (about six miles).\r\nShekalim 7:4 doesn‚Äôt say anything at all about shepherds. This\r\nentire passage merely states that any unattended animals within\r\nabout six miles of Jerusalem in any direction are assumed to have\r\ncome from Jerusalem, and that the ones from Jerusalem were probably\r\nmeant to be sacrifices, so this one probably was too ‚Äì so if you\r\nrun across one you can pluck it up and offer it.\r\nThere is no logical pathway between Shekalim 7:4 and the conclusion that\r\nspecial shepherds watched over flocks of lamb and goat in Migdal Eder\r\nthat were specifically raised for sacrifice. Edersheim just imagined\r\nthis to be the case and declared that it was supported by the Mishnah\r\nwhich isn‚Äôt a valid information source for early 1st Century CE\r\npractices anyway.\r\nThe entire premise of this narrative was invented in 1883. No data\r\nfrom the ancient world support this notion and Edersheim‚Äôs 1883 work is\r\nthe first record of it.\r\nBut Edershiem‚Äôs proposition doesn‚Äôt quite provide all the details of the\r\nnarrative we‚Äôre examining here. There was no mention of lambs being\r\nswaddled and placed in mangers. So where does that come from? From the\r\n2012 book Jesus: a Theography. I don‚Äôt have access to their text but\r\nNunally (2023) reproduces relevant sections:\r\n\r\nBut before they were slaughtered, each lamb was required to be a pet\r\nin the family for at least four days. So the day after the final\r\nSabbath before Passover, shepherds from the Bethlehem hills drove\r\nthousands of lambs into Jerusalem, where they were taken in by Jewish\r\nfamilies for at least two days and treated as members of the family.\r\nBefore sacrificing the lamb, the Jewish priest would ask, ‚ÄúDo you love\r\nthis lamb?‚Äù If the family didn‚Äôt love the lamb, there would be no\r\nsacrifice (Sweet/Viola, p.¬†66).\r\n\r\nReally? This procedure is not extant in the Bible or even the Mishnah ‚Äì\r\nso where did Sweet and Viola get it?\r\n\r\nBethlehem‚Äôs priestly shepherds had to learn and follow special\r\ntechniques and rituals during the lambing season. Bethlehem lambs born\r\nfor slaughter were special lambs. To prevent harm and self-injury from\r\nthrashing about after birth on their spindly legs, newborn lambs were\r\nwrapped in swaddling cloths. Then they were placed in a manger or\r\nfeeding trough, where they could calm down out of harm‚Äôs way\r\n(Sweet/Viola, p.¬†67).\r\n\r\nHarm and self injury? Are there any data suggesting new born lambs\r\ninjure themselves from thrashing around immediately upon birth? A modern\r\nstudy (Holm√∏y et al. 2017) of 270 lamb deaths that occurred within 5\r\ndays of birth found trauma to be the causative agent in 20% of cases; of\r\nthese the most frequent cause of trauma was difficult birthing that\r\nrequired human assistance ‚Äì 60% of all trauma deaths. The authors\r\nreport that ‚Äútraumatic injuries to the lamb may occur during birth,\r\nparticularly in cases of fetopelvic disproportion. Lambs confined\r\nindoors may be trapped in pen hurdles, and small or inappropriately\r\nshaped lambing pens may increase the risk of injuries inflicted by\r\newes.‚Äù They list no other causes for lamb trauma and while this paper\r\nwas limited to trauma that resulted in death, the notion that a new born\r\nlamb would thrash around and fracture a limb or incur some other serious\r\ninjury that qualifies as a ‚Äúblemish‚Äù doesn‚Äôt seem plausible.\r\nSimcock (2019) indicates that immediate suckling is imperative to\r\nsurvival because lambs require ‚Äú50mls [of colostrum (ewe‚Äôs milk)] per kg\r\nof body weight [typical birth weights are 3-6 kg] in the first two hours\r\nafter birth.‚Äù This doesn‚Äôt seem possible if the lamb is tightly wrapped\r\nin cloth and sequestered in a stone trough. I asked a representative of\r\nJenkins Farms (a\r\nsmall farm in Georgia) about pathways for baby goat injuries and\r\npreventive measures17. The response indicated they: are susceptible\r\nto hypothermia (if they get wet and cold they die); may get trapped in\r\nequipment or other places and die; may swallow hay string and die, eat a\r\nlot of milk and sit out in the sun and die; that sprains and strains\r\ntypically heal on their own, but sometimes they have to amputate legs\r\n(no indication of what causes these strains and sprains). The response\r\nto preventative measures was that they provide the animals with a\r\nsheltered place and let the mothers do the work.\r\nDid Sweet and Viola just make this up? I think so. Nunally (2023)\r\npoints out that they never cite any sources to support the claims in\r\ntheir 2012 book and he exhaustively examines specific claims therein,\r\nfirmly concluding\r\n\r\nThe assertion by Edersheim (and a plethora of others who follow\r\nhim) on the basis of BT Bava Kama 80a18, that the sheep being\r\nkept by the shepherds of Bethlehem/Migdal Eder had to have been a\r\nspecial herd destined for the temple has to be rejected. The\r\nevidence introduced above demands it.The popularity of the NBN,\r\nthe persuasiveness of the presentation of its advocates, the warm\r\nfeeling experienced by those who embrace it, and the sense of\r\ngreater importance that comes with having insider knowledge‚ÄîNONE\r\nof these are worth the abandonment of our belief in absolute truth\r\nbased on evidence.\r\nThese and all the other incredibly detailed additions to the story\r\nof Jesus‚Äô birth that are floating around today would be great if\r\nthey were true, but they are simply the products of the fertile\r\nimaginations of modern-day midrashists. Our response to all who\r\nwould abridge, edit, or add to the Word of God as written, or\r\noverthrow hundreds of years of interpretation must be ‚ÄúShow us\r\nyour evidence and then we will evaluate it for ourselves!‚Äù If\r\nnothing more than conjecture, ramblings from unaccountable authors\r\non non-peer-reviewed websites, and a titillating feel-good story\r\nare all they have to offer, they are rightly to be ignored.\r\nThere were no priestly shepherds, no special lambs, and no special\r\ntechniques that anyone had to learn to protect them. If there was\r\nevidence for this in ancient literature, this would have been\r\nproduced by those who make such claims.\r\nTo be clear, there is never a place ANYWHERE in ancient Jewish\r\nliterature of ANY kind, whether in the Bible, the Dead Sea\r\nScrolls, the intertestamental Apocrypha, the intertestamental\r\nPseudepigrapha, Philo of Alexandria, Josephus Flavius, or ANYWHERE\r\nin the voluminous Rabbinic Literature that suggests that any lambs\r\nanywhere were ever swaddled. Again, this is why no source is ever\r\ncited by promoters of the NBN when making this point. Further,\r\nboth Palestinian and Jewish shepherds in Israel will tell you that\r\nthis is madness‚Äîwithin hours, a newborn lamb that was swaddled\r\nand laid in a manger would be dead. While teaching in Israel, I\r\nspoke to shepherds in the area of Jerusalem and Bethlehem. When\r\nasked if they were aware of an instance in which it would be\r\nbeneficial to swaddle newborn lambs, without exception, their\r\nresponse was, ‚ÄúWhat? They‚Äôd starve in two hours!‚Äù The story as\r\nbeing told today is not only never documented by reference to\r\nancient literature; it is also patently absurd on the practical\r\nlevel, life experience, and common sense.\r\n\r\nThat‚Äôs about just enough of that.\r\nThe PERFECT LAMB OF GOD!\r\nEncountering this meme/narrative/phenomenon where modern Christians invent stories ‚Äì mostly likely to inject interesting components that engage audiences and keep the stories fresh ‚Äì made me wonder how frequently these kinds of innovations occur. Are there other examples we can find from modern times or ancient times? The next section explores these questions.\r\nBut, before we move on I want to examine one more point on this lamb narrative, that to me, is the most fundamental issue. If Jesus is meant to be\r\n\r\nTHE PERFECT LAMB OF GOD! The Messiah who would sacrifice His life for the sins of the whole world.\r\n\r\nthen how are we to understand the analogy to a lamb and how are we to understand these sacrifices? Why is Jesus so frequently referred to as ‚ÄúThe Lamb‚Äù? Why does Jesus need to sacrifice his human life19 to somehow, in some way, offset or pay for or atone for the sins of the world. How does that work? What is the mechanism by which Jesus suffering a terrible death enables salvation? Salvation from what? How do modern Christians understand the status quo if Jesus had not yet spent a while as a human so that humans could murder him? For instance, what was the status quo with respect to salvation in the year 10 CE?\r\nTo gain this understanding, we must study exactly how Jesus is analogized with Second Temple Period animal sacrificial practices in Judaism and how those practices fit within the broader context of animal sacrifice in the the ancient world.\r\nRegev (2019) provides an exhaustive discussion of how early Christians understood and related to the Temple and elements of the sacrificial cult that operated there until the Romans destroyed it in 70 CE ‚Äì around the time the Gospel that would later be attributed to Mark was written. For brevity I will focus on Regev‚Äôs analysis of how Paul analogizes Jesus as:\r\n\r\nHistorical Context ‚Äì Israel and Contemporaneous Cultures**\r\nThe development of a coherent group of people known as Israel in the\r\nSouthern Levant almost certainly occurred after 1350 BCE and before 1200\r\nBCE. The first mention of Israel as a coherent people group for which\r\ndata exists is around 1207 BCE on the Merneptah\r\nStele, a large\r\ninscription on stone of Egyptian origin that describes Merneptah‚Äôs\r\nconquest of various peoples in the Levant including Israel\r\n(J. Wright 2023). The specific language of the Stele indicates Israel\r\nwas not yet a nation or kingdom, but it‚Äôs certain that a coherent people\r\ngroup called Israel were known in the southern Levant around 1207. It is\r\nalso almost certain that no such group existed at large scale around\r\n1350 BCE based on references to places and names from the Amarna\r\nLetters20 that should have included Israel and its prominent figures\r\nif such a people were extant at the time (J. Wright 2023).21\r\nIsraelite sacrificial practices evolved over centuries before reaching\r\nthe exact form practiced around the time Jesus was likely born, but all\r\nof their elements (altar, temple, sacrificial system) are ‚Äúrooted in the\r\npagan cultures of the ancient Near East‚Äù (Haran 1978). The most\r\nobvious and directly correlated source is the\r\nSumerian/Akkadian/Babylonian cultures in Mesopotamia that originate as\r\nearly as the 4th millennium BCE and formally end in 539 BCE at the hands\r\nof the Persians. This period entirely encompasses the development of\r\nIsrael as a people and Kingdom.\r\nThe Mesopotamian gods Marduk, Sarpanitum, Nabu, Nanay, and others among\r\nthe pantheon each required their own specific daily diet of animal\r\nsacrifice (bulls, sheep, birds, fish) along with fruits, plants, grains,\r\nand beer (Scurlock 2002). Babylonians ‚Äúfed‚Äù their gods twice a\r\nday every day and while the presentation and disposition of these\r\noffering was different than the Israelite practice22, ‚ÄúLike their\r\nancient Mesopotamian counterparts, Israelite holocaust offerings were\r\nimagined as divine meals, presented twice daily at dawn and dusk, with\r\nextra animals offered weekly on the Sabbath, monthly at the new moon,\r\nand annually on days set aside as festivals.‚Äù\r\n(Scurlock 2006). The Mesopotamian sacrificial cult included\r\nsacrifices for different purposes including ‚Äúcovenant‚Äù sacrifices used\r\nto establish a contractual style relationship with a god (usually\r\nfollowed by daily feeding), ‚Äúoccasional‚Äù sacrifices for specific favors\r\nor requests, ‚Äúdivination‚Äù sacrifices to discern truth, and ‚Äútreaty‚Äù\r\nsacrifices to ensure the sanctity of an oath\r\n(Scurlock 2006).\r\nSacrifices to ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (Yahweh)23 in ancient Israel were also\r\nconceptualized as food; the authors of the Bible refer to sacrificial\r\nitems as God‚Äôs ‚Äúfood‚Äù (Leviticus 3:11, 21:21-22, Numbers 28:2), and to\r\nthe altar as ‚ÄúThe Lord‚Äôs Table‚Äù (see Ezekiel 41:22, 44:16, Malachi 1:7).\r\nLike the Mesopotamian gods, ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î also required feeding twice a\r\nday ‚Äì a diet of 2 lambs (one in the morning and one in the evening)\r\nwith flour, oil, grain, and wine (see Exodus 29:38‚Äì42 and Numbers\r\n28:1‚Äì8). There were also different categories of sacrifice ‚Äì the guilt\r\nor sin offerings, vow offerings, and the covenant offering (the\r\nPassover). The Passover sacrifice only occurred once a year and\r\nmaintained the contractual relationship between God and Israel\r\nestablished during the Exodus.\r\nHittite, Eyptian, Greco-Roman sacrificial practices were similar.\r\nM. Smith (1952) notes that ‚ÄúThe similarities of the sacrificial cult\r\nof Uruk24 to that described in the P material of the OT25 are\r\nclear. Even of later times, when the Jews were self-consciously\r\ninsisting on their difference from the heathen, Lieberman26 can\r\nremark, ‚ÄòThere was a general pattern in ancient world of temples and\r\nsacrifices ‚Ä¶ which the Jews shared‚Äô‚Äù. In Greece and Rome it was the\r\n‚Äúgeneral custom to burn the whole victim (·ΩÅŒªŒøŒ∫Œ±œÖœÑŒµ·øñŒΩ) upon the altars of\r\nthe gods, and the same was in some cases also observed in later times\r\n(Xenoph. Anab. VII.8 ¬ß5), and more especially in sacrifices to the gods\r\nof the lower world, and such as were offered to atone for some crime\r\nthat had been committed (Apollon. Rhod. III.1030, 1209)‚Äù\r\n(Schmitz 1875). Greek practices varied by city-state but\r\ngenerally the animals had to be ‚Äúhealthy, beautiful and uninjured‚Äù\r\n(Schmitz 1875).\r\nBut the Passover sacrifice was a bit particular and its association with\r\nChristianity is interesting. Let‚Äôs revisit.\r\nThe Passover was an annual reminder of the Exodus when, in the story,\r\n◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (Yahweh) killed every first born Egyptian from the\r\nPharaoh to the slaves to the animals (Exodus 11:4-5). To avoid\r\n◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (Yahweh‚Äôs) death, the Israelites had to kill a lamb and\r\nsmear its blood on the doorposts so that ◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (Yahweh) would\r\nknow to ‚Äúpass over‚Äù that house. The ritual by the first Century was\r\nparticular. Families would offer lambs or kids, slaughter them, the\r\npreists would and catch the blood in little bowls and sprinkle it on the\r\naltar in the Temple. Fatty portions of the animal were reserved for\r\n◊ô◊î◊ï◊î (Yahweh) and burned on the altar [And the priest shall\r\nburn them upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire\r\nfor a sweet savour: all the fat is the Lord‚Äôs. (Leviticus 3:16)].\r\nEveryone had to be ritually clean to participate.\r\nSo what do we make of all this? A few particular observations are\r\nimportant\r\nThat animal sacrifice to gods to seek favors or excuse\r\ntransgressions was common across cultures in ancient Mediterranean\r\ncultures (all of the above is vaguely contemporaneous)\r\nThat the general form and function of the sacrifices was at least\r\nbroadly similar across cultures and to all the various gods, some\r\nsacrifices imagined as food for the goods, some sacrifices entirely\r\nburned on an altar)\r\nThat\r\nLike most studies, this study presents tangential topics that are\r\nrelevant to the discussion above, and that I think are critical context\r\nfor understanding this narrative and the phenomenon of inventing or\r\nembellishing for a variety of motivating factors (all of which are\r\nroutine facets of human nature).\r\nImaginative Judeo-Christian Innovation is Not Rare or New\r\nThe discussion above illustrates that the lamb symbology narrative\r\nintroduced at the beginning is a modern fiction that originated in the\r\n19th Century, was further embellished in 2012, and is now firmly\r\nentrenched in modern Christian mythology (it‚Äôs even in The Chosen\r\nmovie series). But the process of inventing narrative and/or\r\nembellishing extant narratives over time is not at all unusual in\r\nmodern times or throughout the history of the Judeo-Christian religious\r\ntradition27. The subsections below illustrate a few examples. While\r\neach of these really demands its own version of this document, the\r\nconstraints of time and energy limit these discussions to cursory\r\nintroductions28.\r\nOther Modern Examples\r\nModern tales of miracle and prophecy and revealed secrets abound in the\r\nmodern age. The sections below illustrate a few examples of demonstrable\r\nnonsense:\r\nA Bible in Dalton, GA Exudes Magic Healing Oil After President Donald J. Trump‚Äôs 2017 Inauguration\r\nIn Dalton, GA, a man named Jerry Pearce ‚Äúfell down on the floor for 45\r\nminutes in a kind of catatonic state that he describes as being ‚Äòout in\r\nthe Spirit.‚Äô‚Äù during a prayer session shortly after President Donald\r\nTrump‚Äôs inauguration in 2017 (Graham 2020). A few days later his\r\nBible allegedly started exuding oil. First just a bit, then gallons,\r\nthen hundreds of gallons. The oil apparently possessed magical powers. A\r\nreporter (Graham 2020) who attended one of the weekly events\r\nwhere the oil was distributed described\r\n\r\nA slight white man said he was heading to China soon and wanted to\r\nbring the oil with him. He alluded to the possibility that the oil\r\ncould cure the coronavirus: ‚ÄúI look forward to bringing back a good\r\nreport!‚Äù There were stories about the oil healing arthritis and\r\ndissolving tumors. Others said their vials of oil had spontaneously\r\nrefilled. One woman said she had given it to a friend who traveled to\r\nNorth Korea and slathered three rocks there with oil, including one\r\nrepresenting North Korea and one representing the United States.\r\n‚ÄúRight after that was when Trump met with Kim Jong-un,‚Äù she said. The\r\ncrowd murmured in awe.\r\n\r\nReally? My mother possesses three vials of this oil, given to her by\r\nfriends after a car accident. I look at them when I‚Äôm visiting sometimes\r\nbut haven‚Äôt noticed them refilling themselves.\r\nA reporter at the Chattanooga Times Free Press covering the story was\r\neventually directed to employees at the local Tractor Supply who\r\nvisually identified Jerry as regularly buying gallons of mineral oil.\r\nTwo independent Fourier Transform Infrared spectroscope (FTIR) profiles\r\nof the oil developed in two different departments at the University of\r\nTennessee in Chattanooga ‚Äúindicate a petroleum derived product,\r\nparticularly mineral oil.‚Äù (Massey 2020) ‚Äì see the actual lab\r\nreport embedded in the news article. Pearce initially denied buying\r\nmineral oil and stated that the Tractor Supply employees were lying, but\r\nafter the Times reporting was published, Flowing Oil Ministries (the\r\ngroup organizing events related to the oil) revealed that the Bible had\r\nrecently stopped producing oil. Pearce then admitted to buying oil just\r\nthat last time stating (Massey 2020):\r\n\r\n‚ÄúI was going to pour that oil on the Bible when the Bible quit\r\nproducing oil,‚Äù Pearce said. ‚ÄúAnd the Lord checked my spirit on it.‚Äù\r\n\r\nOf course.\r\nA retired Nurse Anesthetist Recovers the Actual Ark of the Covenant from Israel\r\nSee Ron Wyatt for a litany of nonsense. The short version is that he\r\nclaimed to have found artifacts like (Jackson n.d.):\r\n\r\nNoah‚Äôs Home and a Flood-inscription at that site\r\nFences from Noah‚Äôs farm\r\nAnchor Stones from Noah‚Äôs Ark\r\nLaminated Deck Timber from the Ark\r\nNoah‚Äôs Altar\r\nTombs with Tombstones of Noah and his wife\r\nThe precise location of the Red Sea Crossing\r\nWheels from Egyptian Chariots involved in the pursuit of the\r\nIsraelites from Egypt [for a detailed discussion see Bible\r\nArcheology\r\nReport.]\r\nThe Book of the Law written by Moses on Animal Skins\r\nGold from the Golden Calf fashioned by Aaron\r\nThe Ark of the Covenant\r\nTables of the Ten Commandments\r\nThe Tabernacle‚Äôs Table of the Showbread\r\nGoliath‚Äôs Sword,\r\nJesus‚Äô Tomb and the Stone Seal of the Tomb,\r\nA sampling of Christ‚Äôs Dried Blood, proving the doctrine of the\r\nVirgin Birth by means of a ‚Äúchromosome count,‚Äù etc.\r\n\r\nHe never produced such artifacts or provided evidence to archaeologists\r\nor biologists.

    "description": "President Joe Biden's release of approximately 200M barrels of oil from the US Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in and after 2021 garnered criticism from conservative politicians, pundits, and media. Some criticisms asserted the release was a misuse of the reserve as political tool while others incorporated language suggesting the drawdown was a threat to national security. This article examines the history and purpose of the SPR, and conducts an analysis of the drawdown and historical SPR levels relative to specific claims from critics in the context of that history and purpose.",

Do We Even Need an SPR?\r\nWhat‚Äôs the Real Answer?\r\n\r\nCaveats\r\n\r\nA Very Brief History of the SPR\r\nAny reasonably thorough treatment of such a history will require much more time and effort than I will expend; this history is very brief indeed, and I‚Äôm going to quote most of it from other sources such as from this Congressional Research Services report (Bamberger 2009):\r\n\r\nCongress authorized the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) in the Energy Policy and Conservation Act (EPCA, P.L. 94-163) to help prevent a repetition of the economic dislocation caused by the 1973-1974 Arab oil embargo. The program is managed by the Department of Energy (DOE). The capacity of the SPR is 727 million barrels, and by the end of 2009, was virtually filled to its capacity at 726 million barrels of crude oil.\r\n\r\nBut the SPR is not a unilateral construct. The development of the US SPR occurred in concert with the creation of the International Energy Agency (IEA). During the embargo and the global petroleum supply chain chaos that followed, it became evident that little machinery existed for the global governance of the oil supply chain.1\r\n\r\nIn February 1974, the United States convened the major oil consumers in an international energy conference aimed at filling such governance gaps. The negotiations led to agreement in November of that year on an International Energy Program (IEP), which the IEA was created to implement‚Ä¶.Under the IEP, all member states agreed to maintain oil reserves equivalent to at least 60-days of net oil imports (later increased to 90-days). (Florini 2011)\r\n\r\nThe founding members included Austria, Belgium, Canada, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, The Netherlands, Norway, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Turkey, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\r\nThe general idea was that countries that were major oil importers maintained reserves to act as a deterrent to the potential threat of another embargo from oil exporters.\r\nToday there are 30 member states and other nations have looser associations with the IEA, including China, India, Israel and many others.\r\nCriticisms of President Biden‚Äôs SPR Drawdown\r\nIt‚Äôs easy to understand how many Americans may believe the 2021-2023 SPR draw down to be a seriously irresponsible use of a national security asset. Depending on the spectrum of media consumed, a Republican viewer may have encountered statements and reporting as below without any counter-argument or contextual analysis.\r\nA NewsMax article (Barney 2023) quotes former House Speaker Kevin McCarthy as saying\r\n\r\nOur Strategic Petroleum Reserve is down to nothing.\r\n\r\nA Newsmax video segment (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYuQRR0F57w) hosted by Carl Higbie included his assertion that:\r\n\r\nWe all remember how President Biden treated the SPR, as his personal ATM, making withdrawal after withdrawal after withdrawal, without a care in the world for the long term repercussions which we all warned him about.\r\n\r\nDuring this same video segment the guest, Larry Elder, asserted that this draw down demonstrated how\r\n\r\nThe Biden administration has jeopardized national security in so many different ways\r\n\r\nThe same video displays the graphic below ‚Äì the commentary implies that 17 days remaining in the SPR is a national security risk:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Source: Newsmax video segment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYuQRR0F57w\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn a March 2023 House Committee hearing titled ‚ÄúBurning the Midnight Oil: Why Depleting the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is Not a Solution to America‚Äôs Energy Problem, Part 1.‚Äù the following remarks were publicized (United States House Committee on Oversight and Accountability 2024):\r\n\r\nInstead of responding to high gas prices by reversing his own anti-American energy policies, President Biden chose to manipulate short-term prices by depleting our SPR.\r\nPresident Biden must take responsibility for his abuse of the SPR, which has put America‚Äôs national security at risk.\r\nRep.¬†Fallon [to Mr.¬†Alex Epstein, President of the Center for Industrial Progress]: ‚ÄúDoes the decision to deplete the SPR to historically low levels mean the Biden Administration has no real plan for American energy policy?‚Äù\r\nMr.¬†Epstein: ‚ÄúI think saying ‚Äòno real plan‚Äô is too charitable. I think they have a very bad plan. The basic plan is to rapidly eliminate fossil fuels as soon as possible, and then pretend that they can be replaced by unreliable solar and wind.‚Äù\r\n\r\nCongressman Tom Cole (R. OK) released the following statement (Cole 2022):\r\n\r\nPresident Biden‚Äôs decision to release more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is misguided, reckless and completely irresponsible‚Ä¶.The answer is to unleash domestic energy production to supply more oil and gas. America is producing nearly two million barrels a day less than we were in 2020. President Biden could easily reverse the policies he implemented on day one, including restarting the Keystone XL pipeline, reopening federal lands for more exploration and production and adopting policies that encourage, rather than disparage, our domestic energy industry.\r\n\r\nIn a letter to Energy Secretary Jennifer Granholm, Representative James Comer (R. KY) and Representative Pat Fallon (R. TX) (Comer and Fallon 2024) write\r\n\r\nCommittee Republicans are concerned the Biden Administration abused the SPR for political gain ‚Äî to lower skyrocketing gas prices before the 2022 midterm election ‚Äî rather than for its intended purpose of mitigating severe energy supply interruptions or fulfilling obligations to the International Energy Agency (IEA).\r\n\r\nFormer Energy Secretary and former Texas Governor Rick Perry (Perry 2022) writes in a Fox News opinion piece:\r\n\r\nThe SPR is not the president‚Äôs personal oil supply. Yet, Biden has been treating it as a political band-aid since he took office. According to the Energy Information Administration (EIA), U.S. petroleum reserves are down 230 million barrels since Biden‚Äôs Inauguration and are at the lowest they‚Äôve been since the Summer of 1984. With levels dangerously low, the administration just requested the release of another 15 million barrels. By the end of the year, U.S. reserves will be down a staggering 255 million barrels.\r\n\r\nDozens more such reporting and official statements exist; consult your favorite search engine. But I include one more because its examination is important.\r\nAs reported in Forbes (Rapier 2022) and announced through his spokesperson on X2, Former President Trump made the following assertion:\r\n\r\nSo after 50 years of being virtually empty, I built up our oil reserves during my administration, and low energy prices, to 100% full. It‚Äôs called the Strategic National Reserves, and it hasn‚Äôt been full for many decades. In fact, it‚Äôs been mostly empty. It‚Äôs supposed to only be used for large-scale emergency or conflict. Now I see where Biden has just announced he‚Äôs going to take what we so carefully and magically built, and what will be a futile attempt to reduce oil and gasoline prices. They will soon bring it down to empty again. It just never ends!\r\n\r\nExamining these Criticisms Critically\r\nA reasonable observer with moderate knowledge of political science and history might categorize some of these criticisms as normal3 political brinkmanship in that one side finds it necessary to always criticize what the other side is doing as undesirable or unacceptable, mostly regardless of what is actually being done. Normal brinkmanship includes the full spectrum of rhetorical devices (many of which are logically fallacious) to argue that the other side is not good at all. I‚Äôm not going to examine every assertion in every statement4, but in a broad review, I will argue that all of the statements above are either: (1) misleading political rhetoric because they ignore critical context, exaggerate, and cherry pick data; or (2) patently false or intentionally misleading propaganda ‚Äì beyond what I would think of as normal political rhetoric.\r\n‚ÄúDown to Nothing‚Äù\r\nWhen former House Speaker McCarthy stated that the SPR was ‚Äúdown to nothing‚Äù in Oct of 2023 he defined ‚Äúnothing‚Äù as about 350 Million barrels5. That volume is about 48% of the physical capacity of the SPR, but in mid-March, 2021, just before the Biden Administration began the exchanges and sales, the SPR only contained 637M barrels. So the volume in the SPR at the Time of McCarthy‚Äôs statement was about 55% of the initial volume prior to executive actions. So we‚Äôre running at about half a tank, so to speak.\r\nWhat kind of practical volume is that? is that level strategically dangerous? There are different ways to conceptualize the mission of the SPR. The formal requirement under the IEP is that member states maintain 90 days of net imports. The United States ‚Äúhas been a net exporter of crude oil and petroleum products from September 2019 through [June 2024]. The IEP does not require net exporters to maintain a petroleum stockpile‚Äù (Greenley 2020).\r\nThe data below illustrate long term trends in U.S Net Oil and Petroleum imports.6\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Source: Energy Information Agency (https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=mttntus2&f=m)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExamining SPR inventory in relation to total US oil imports is another possibility. Even though the US is currently a net exporter, we still import about 6-8M barrels per day. Below we examine the total number of import days to which the SPR inventory equates (i.e.¬†how many days could the SPR supply total US oil import requirements assuming constant imports starting on day 0). The SPR can not, and is not intended to, replace the entire bulk of US imports because its distribution throughput is limited to 4.4M7 barrels per day, so this isn‚Äôt a realistic measure of strategic safety, just a relative measure of how SPR inventory was related to total US oil imports over time.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Source: SPR inventory from: https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=WCSSTUS1&f=W ; US Imports from:https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=mcrimus2&f=m\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nViewed this way, it‚Äôs reasonable to state that the SPR level is historically low. When we think of the SPR as equivalent to days of total oil imports, the current SPR inventory is about the same as it was in 2001 (as of May 2024 ‚Äì the most recent data available ‚Äì it was 52.2 days, compared to April 2001 when it was 53.6 days).\r\nBut one other factor complicates the interpretation of this data. The origin of US imports has gradually shifted away from OPEC and other potentially adversarial nations toward allies and partners. In 2001, the US imported 28% of its oil from Canada and Mexico and similarly about 28% from OPEC nations or Russia; in 2023 the US imported 61% of its oil from Canada and Mexico while importing 12% from OPEC nations or Russia.8 So does the SPR today need to be the same size (relative to US imports) as it was in 2001?\r\nTo state that the SPR inventory is ‚Äúdown to nothing‚Äù or that it has been ‚Äúdepleted‚Äù9 is inaccurate political rhetoric. It is accurate to state that SPR levels are low relative to historical levels, but the national security implications and policy implications of this level are ambiguous at best and it is demonstrable that Republican lawmakers in general are not significantly concerned about an SPR inventory at this level ‚Äì we will see why later in this analysis.\r\n‚ÄúPersonal ATM‚Äù\r\nThe statement from Carl Higbie that ‚ÄúPresident Biden treated the SPR, as his personal ATM‚Äù has no basis in fact and is intentionally crafted propaganda designed to plant in the viewers‚Äô minds the idea that President Biden is personally using the funds from the sale of oil from the SPR. Some energy policy scholars used the ‚ÄúATM‚Äù metaphor because the government used SPR sales to fund legislation (Razek et al. 2023). Proceeds from SPR sales go to the general fund for deficit reduction or to specific funds for SPR modernization and maintenance by law. But, some people who saw this video probably believe it. It has been viewed ~20,000 times in 10 months as of this writing. Some comments include:\r\n\r\nBrandon has committed so many traitorous acts n got rich doin it!!\r\nThat‚Äôs just what we know about. He was caught selling a portion of it to china10\r\nBring Donald Trump back and we can start selling and imported gas and be the number one seller of gas and oil11\r\n\r\nThere are many such comments; comments above are reproduced without changes to grammar or spelling.\r\nLegal action against such misrepresentations is unlikely to succeed. The individual or organization can assert the statement was just a metaphor, just entertainment, obviously not meant to be taken seriously and no reasonable person would believe it. We know this argument works because it is the successful legal defense mounted by Tucker Carlson and Fox News against a libel suit brought by Karen McDougal ‚Äì the Playboy model who allegedly had an affair with former President Trump and to whom President Trump allegedly paid $150,000 for keeping the story out of the public12 . Carlson widely implied McDougal was extorting the former President. The judge wrote in the ruling that\r\n\r\nFox persuasively argues . . . that given Mr.¬†Carlson‚Äôs reputation, any reasonable viewer arrives with an appropriate amount of skepticism about the statements he makes‚Ä¶[w]hether the Court frames Mr.¬†Carlson‚Äôs statements as exaggeration, non-literal commentary, or simply bloviating for his audience, the conclusion remains the same‚Äîthe statements are not actionable (Fawbush 2020) .\r\n\r\nThe ruling makes no consideration for the effects of such media on ‚Äúunreasonable‚Äù viewers, nor does it attempt to ascertain the proportion of the audience that might reasonably be classified as ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù. I hypothesize that proportion to be relatively small.\r\n17 Days Remain\r\nNow‚Ä¶that graphic; let‚Äôs see it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 4: Source: Newsmax video segment https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TYuQRR0F57w\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbove we examined a time equivalent for the SPR that was days worth of total US imports and those numbers were quite different (never below 49), so we need to figure out what this data actually is.\r\nBefore we do, there are some evident signs that this graphic was intended to deceive rather than to inform. These signs are worth discussing because their usage is common in media without journalistic standards (which is rather a lot of media).\r\nThe y-axis starts at 15 to make the visual line appear near ‚Äúzero‚Äù at the lowest point. This may be intentional. There are circumstances where a truncated y-axis is appropriate (I use them sometimes, and will do so later in this document ‚Äì when I want to examine changes in the data that are small in scale relative to the total magnitude of the data), and some graphics libraries will truncate axes to the range of the data by default. Axis truncation is generally not best practice for data visualization.\r\nWhat is certainly intentional is that horizontal grid lines all represent a change of 5 except the jump from 25-35 which is just bizarre13.\r\nThe title indicates that the line represents ‚ÄúDays Left in the SPR‚Äù, sourced to DOE ‚Äì as we will examine below, these data do not actually appear on the DOE data portals ‚Äì the calculation and title were constructed specifically to create an impression of a drastic and undesirable state. ‚ÄúDays left‚Äù implies a clock actively counting down rather than a static value transformed into a time equivalent.\r\nI couldn‚Äôt find any data indicating a number of days remaining in the SPR for some specific mission on DOE data access portals, so I reverse engineered the graphic by guessing how the content creator might have produced it until I found a procedure that duplicates these results. Here is what I produced14:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 5: Source: Nonsensical Calculation (SPR Inventory/Total US Petroleum Consumption, average values by month). Data for SPR inventory (https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=WCSSTUS1&f=W) and total US consumption (https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=wrpupus2&f=w)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only way to calculate ‚ÄúDays left in the SPR‚Äù and get these numbers is to assume that on day 0: ALL domestic oil production ceases; ALL oil imports from every source cease; the ENTIRE normal daily US consumption of petroleum is extracted from the SPR every day.\r\nThe specific calculation is\r\n\\[Days = \\frac{SPR Inventory}{Total US Petroleum Consumption}\\]\r\ncalculated by week, averaged over each month.\r\nThe DOE does not provide this calculation because it‚Äôs nonsensical, and beyond the intended purpose of the SPR. IEP obligations are 90 days of net imports. The SPR can only physically distribute 4.4M barrels per day. I‚Äôm reasonably confident the content creators chose this calculation specifically to make the situation seem dire.\r\nA final thought on this graphic may influence our perception of the SPR inventory levels in the minds of those critical of the Biden Administration‚Äôs sales. In this segment, in reference to this graphic, the discussion was that prior to the Biden administration‚Äôs SPR sales, the number of ‚ÄúDays Left in the SPR‚Äù was fine and good. Typically 30-35 days. If 35 days worth of SPR for [some SPR purpose] is a good number of days, and our calculation above where the SPR supplies total oil imports gives us ~ 50 days of reserves, can we conclude these commentators actually find the current levels fine and good for any plausible scenario? I think all we can really conclude is that this presentation only seeks to portray the Blue party negatively and the Red party positively and that the content creators either do not possess any real, principled position on SPR inventory and policy, or that they only imagine such principled positions without actually understanding any of the information they are discussing.\r\nBurning the Midnight Oil\r\nI don‚Äôt want to expend the effort required to examine specific claims and points in these exchanges but it is worth noting that Mr.¬†Epstein has a BA in Philosophy from Duke University and has no formal training or practical experience in foreign policy or energy policy. The CIP is a self described ‚Äúfor profit think tank‚Äù that promotes fossil fuel use. See their own information here: https://industrialprogress.com/about/\r\nHis comments and many others referenced above imply Democrat policies that are hostile to American oil production. The phrase ‚ÄúDemocrat War on Oil‚Äù is popular among lawmakers and commentators. How goes the war effort?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 6: Source: Energy Information Agency (https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=pet&s=mcrfpus2&f=m). Shaded blocks indicate political party in power.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNot well it seems.\r\nUS Oil Production seems uncorrelated with the political parties happening to hold power in Congress and in the White House. In a largely free, mixed economy like the U.S., oil production is mostly driven by market calculus ‚Äì what about the dip in production from April 2015 to Sept 2016? Was it the Obama Administration‚Äôs war efforts finally taking effect? Or was it market response to the price of oil falling from $87 a barrel in Sept 2014 to $27 in Jan 201615 combined with lower than expected global economic growth (World Bank Group 2018)? The dip in 2020? Was it the Biden Administration‚Äôs leash on American Oil Production or the market response to depressed demand during the COVID-19 pandemic?\r\nPolicy may make some difference; I argue policy differences are minor effects compared to global market dynamics. What drove the long decline from 1986 until it flattened in 2005 and began climbing in 2008-2009? Prices dropped from $24 a barrel in Dec 1985 to $10 a barrel by April 1986 and remained mostly stagnant until an upward trend began in 2002 and accelerated in 2004.\r\nStatement from Representative Cole\r\nHere it is again\r\n\r\nPresident Biden‚Äôs decision to release more oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve is misguided, reckless and completely irresponsible‚Ä¶.The answer is to unleash domestic energy production to supply more oil and gas. America is producing nearly two million barrels a day less than we were in 2020. President Biden could easily reverse the policies he implemented on day one, including restarting the Keystone XL pipeline, reopening federal lands for more exploration and production and adopting policies that encourage, rather than disparage, our domestic energy industry.\r\n\r\nAs above, I don‚Äôt think the data support the notion that domestic energy production was politically constrained ‚Äì production had declined when the pandemic reduced global demand and production was steadily increasing when Russia invaded Ukraine. This statement was made on March 31, 2022. I hypothesize that in late March, Rep Cole would have had access to production data through either Jan or Feb of 202216. Perhaps Congress has advance access to data that isn‚Äôt publicly available and it‚Äôs possible Rep Cole was thinking in Fiscal years, so let us recall the US Oil production data from above and zoom in on the time period from Oct 2019 through March 2022.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 7: US oil production Jan 2020 - March 2022; same production data as above\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it possible to interpret this data in a way such that we are ‚Äúcurrently‚Äù producing ‚Äúnearly two million barrels a day less than we were in 2020‚Äù? We are constrained to choose an origin in the calendar or fiscal year 2020, but could plausibly choose an end point for ‚Äòcurrent‚Äô production sometime in the recent past relative to March 2022, which could be interpreted broadly.\r\nIf we interpret ‚Äúnearly‚Äù to mean ‚Äúrounds up to but is strictly less than‚Äù, there are 29 pairs of months where the difference in oil production meets these criteria; all of these comparisons require an origin in April 2020 or before ‚Äì Before the Biden Administration began (Figure 8).\r\nWhy do we suppose that is? Surely we don‚Äôt imagine the arms of the Democrat War on Oil are so long that they reach backward through time to fix their leash round the necks of American energy producers?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 8: Possible data comparisons Rep Cole could have used to make the claim that ‚ÄòAmerica is producing nearly two million barrels a day less than we were in 2020‚Äô\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf we fix our origin in Feb 2021, the earliest the ‚Äúpolicies he implemented on day one‚Äù could have taken effect17, then of 14 possible date comparisons available to Rep Cole, all are positive (an increase in production). Of course this is semi-random ‚Äì February 2021 happened to be a particularly low production month but the trend in production since May of 2020 has been positive.\r\nIt is implausible that this comparison is a mistake. Rep Cole (or someone in his office who prepared the statement) intended to portray U.S. oil production as suffering directly from some imagined Biden Administration action and found data that would allow them to construct a statement of condemnation that wasn‚Äôt quite entirely false.\r\nRep Cole mentions the Keystone XL pipeline, and the construction of the sentence groups that specific item within the discussion of American energy production. The Keystone XL pipeline would have been a transport mechanism for the U.S. to import petroleum products from Canada.18\r\nI started researching the federal land issue but I‚Äôm running out of energy on this topic and it seems difficult find information that‚Äôs clear and easy to understand ‚Äì the counter argument is that granting new leases is unlikely to affect production because industry already has access to vast tracts of federal land with approvals for exploration that are unused. Tracking down how the process actually works and whether anything anyone says about this is true would be another one of these documents and another 40-80 hours of labor.\r\nI find representative Cole‚Äôs statement to be a normal political lie. The essence of it is untrue, but there are technical and narrow ways in which the basic premises could be true if interpreted in a specific way (a way that doesn‚Äôt really make any sense, but still). This is how normal political lying works. A common caricature might be: ‚ÄúMy budget cuts the deficit over 10 years‚Äù ‚Äì but only if Congress renews these 8 provisions every 2 years and the U.S. experiences constant year over year GDP growth of 4.6% ‚Äì both of which are unlikely.\r\nThe next section is something a little different ‚Äì normal political lies and rhetoric usually originate from partial truths ‚Äì a truth that holds under unlikely assumptions or narrow circumstances. Or, they may be statements that while basically true omit critical context and alter the perception of those consuming the statement. The normal notion of political lies has been shifting.\r\nStatement from former President Trump\r\nThis statement is assertion dense, so I will examine one piece at a time.\r\n\r\nSo after 50 years of being virtually empty,\r\n\r\nThe SPR has not been anything remotely resembling ‚Äúvirtually empty‚Äù at any point in it‚Äôs history. There is no way to interpret the data that is even vaguely commensurate with this statement. The actual, weekly SPR inventory since 1982 is below:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 9: Source: Energy Information Agency (https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=WCSSTUS1&f=W).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nI built up our oil reserves during my administration, and low energy prices, to 100% full.\r\n\r\nHe did not do this. In Jan of 2017 when former President Trump was sworn in, the SPR contained ~695M barrels (pretty full). When he left office the SPR contained about 637M barrels (still pretty full but 58M barrels lighter). SPR inventory declined during this period because ‚Äúsince 2015, Congress has enacted seven laws containing provisions mandating the sale of SPR oil.These mandated sales from the SPR have committed 271 million barrels of oil for sale through FY2028‚Äù (Greenley 2020).19\r\nThe largest commitment to SPR mandatory sales (100M barrels) came from the FY 2018 budget. President Trump‚Äôs budget. In it, his administration states:\r\n\r\n‚Äúthe Budget proposes to sell approximately 270 million barrels of SPR crude by 2027, leaving roughly half of the remaining SPR inventory after all sales currently authorized by law are completed (approximately 250‚Äì260 million barrels). Given the long-term trajectory of domestic energy production and transportation capabilities, a smaller SPR is projected to be able to continue to meet international obligations and emergency needs. As sales progress, the proposal closes two of the four Gulf Coast SPR sites as determined by a comprehensive analysis of footprint and operations to be conducted‚Äù (Office of Management and Budget 2018).\r\n\r\nThe remaining uncommitted SPR inventory after these sales would be ‚Äúless than 400 million barrels‚Äù (Pirog 2019). This target amount was likely influenced by U.S. net import levels in 2017, when this budget would have been written. The IEP requirement for 90-days of net imports in 2017 was around 340M barrels.\r\nOf a 700M barrel SPR:\r\n\r\n‚ÄúIt‚Äôs no longer necessary,‚Äù said [President Trump‚Äôs] White House budget chief Mick Mulvaney recently [2017]. ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt need to take this much of your money to bury in the ground out in West Texas someplace for domestic security and national security reasons when we have domestic surpluses ‚Äî supplies like we do.‚Äù Conservative and free-market groups, like the Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute, have long called for draining the Strategic Petroleum Reserve, but the idea has caught hold with the Trump White House. More than two dozen Heritage staffers worked on the White House transition team earlier this year and drafted a conservative budget blueprint that proposed selling the reserve (Koss 2017).\r\n\r\nThe same article (Koss 2017) reports\r\n\r\nCongressional Democrats, though, are signaling some opposition to a large-scale sale of the oil supply, citing national security.\r\nSen.¬†Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), ranking member of ENR, noted the SPR‚Äôs past role in quelling markets disrupted by hurricanes. ‚ÄúYou could have a Katrina, you could have a terrorist attack,‚Äù Cantwell said. ‚ÄúThe ways these guys are cyberattacking energy, you could have all sorts of things happen.‚Äù\r\n\r\nhmmm‚Ä¶interesting.\r\nAll of the legislation mandating these sales was passed between 2015 and 2018. Beginning with the legislative session in 2015 Republicans enjoyed majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate; most of this of this legislation was signed into law by President Trump. The 2018 budget plan to reduce SPR inventories was reported in various outlets at the time ((Gramer 2024), (Mufson and Mooney 2017), (Koss 2017)) including Newsmax (Flavelle 2017).\r\nRepresentative Comer was not in Congress for the earlier laws, but voted against the 2018 budget at large, yes, to a reconciliation Bill for the 2018 budget, and no to the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018. Representatives McCarthy and Cole voted yes for all of this legislation 20\r\nBut I digress. Let‚Äôs continue our examination of President Trump‚Äôs statement.\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs called the Strategic National Reserves\r\n\r\nIt is not called this.\r\n\r\nand it hasn‚Äôt been full for many decades.\r\n\r\nThis is technically true, the SPR has not been at physical capacity most of its history ‚Äì It reached capacity in the spring of 2009 and remained full until July of 2011 when the emergency sale of 30M barrels was authorized as part of coordinated IEA release in response to disruptions to global supplies from unrest in Libya.\r\n\r\nIn fact, it‚Äôs been mostly empty.\r\n\r\nIt has not been.\r\n\r\nIt‚Äôs supposed to only be used for large-scale emergency or conflict. Now I see where Biden has just announced he‚Äôs going to take what we so carefully and magically built, and what will be a futile attempt to reduce oil and gasoline prices. They will soon bring it down to empty again. It just never ends!\r\n\r\nThe Biden Administrations SPR withdrawals occurred via distinct legal mechanisms. Some of the sales were accelerations of the already Congressionally mandated sales of 270M barrels by 2027. Others were exchanges (required to be replaced) but the bulk were direct sales. Those replacements for exchanges began in August of 2023 and have since brought SPR inventory back to 378M barrels.21\r\nShort-Term Political Gain? Do We Even Need an SPR?\r\nConservative outlets aren‚Äôt always opposed to tapping the SPR to reduce gas prices ahead of an election. One Newsmax writer (Cunningham 2018) suggests that\r\n\r\nIf U.S. President Donald Trump wants to lower pump prices, he doesn‚Äôt have to rely on OPEC. He has a 660-million-barrel emergency oil stockpile at his disposal. Releasing some of that crude in September or October could dampen gasoline prices ahead of November mid-term elections.\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell President Trump did not take that advice, but the publication of such an article suggests that outrage at gas price reduction via SPR sales ahead of an election, at least in some media, is predicated on the color of the party occupying the White House. I hypothesize that most Americans, absent any media consumption, would be ambivalent on whether such a concept was good or bad. How many hours a year does an average American spend studying energy policy? I don‚Äôt have any data but my guess is a number of hours statistically identical to zero22. Sharing those sick memes does not count. For an average American, gaining sufficient knowledge and expertise to really understand the pros, cons, secondary and tertiary effects of, limitations on, and motivations behind SPR actions relative to the global petroleum market and geopolitical machinations likely requires thousands of hours of study. One example of scholarly analysis of the Biden Administrations SPR release that‚Äôs publicly available is (Razek et al. 2023). I encourage anyone reading this document to scan it and observe the differences between news press and actual research.\r\nScholarship regarding the continued value of strategic petroleum stock is widely varied. A 2006 study (Considine 2006) finds\r\n\r\nThe importance of SPR ‚Ä¶ largely depends upon the effect of stock sales on market prices. To address this question, this study develops a monthly econometric model of the world crude oil market. Inventories, consumption, production, and prices for crude oil are determined within a dominant producer pricing framework in which Saudi Arabia adjusts output based upon market demand and competitive fringe supply ‚Ä¶ [The analysis] indicates that while SPR sales can lower world prices during a supply shock, the required drawdown would be so substantial the reserve would be significantly depleted after just a few months. These findings suggest that once played, the SPR card has modest impacts on world prices and could be easily trumped by actions of other players, including output adjustments by world oil producers.\r\n\r\nThe more recent study mentioned above (Razek et al. 2023) of the Biden Administration 2022 SPR releases in response to Russia‚Äôs invasion of Ukraine concludes that while SPR release and other global supply additions generally reduce price inflation in some circumstances,\r\n\r\nThe impacts of U.S. SPR releases [in 2022] on global crude oil prices are likely to be short-lived and trivial, if there is any impact at all. Hence, it would be misguided to attribute global oil price decreases solely to SPR releases, as doing so would dismiss the impact of the fundamentals of global markets, expectations, and geopolitical risks. Through the use of Granger causality and threshold cointegration, we presented empirical evidence in support of the view that SPR releases‚Äîeven exceptionally large ones‚Äîare unlikely to affect OPEC production, which vitally influences global oil prices. Thus, the recent SPR releases may not be an effective price control mechanism, beyond the temporary psychological impacts on commodity exchanges.\r\n\r\nSome actual policy analysts on the more distant right (Heritage Foundation) or libertarian (Cato Institute) parts of the political spectrum argue that the SPR is obsolete or ineffective and that the US should divest from it entirely ((Loris 2015), (Taylor and Van Dorn 2005)).\r\nBut scholarship does not universally suggest the SPR itself is of limited value. Scholars at Columbia University‚Äôs Center on Global Energy Policy (Bordoff, Halff, and Losz 2018) argue vigorously and convincingly for the continued advantages of an SPR but acknowledge challenges to its effective management and usage. The statements below are from various sections in the report but summarize key points\r\n\r\nDecisions [writing in 2018 this refers to the Congressional mandates for SPR draw downs] to sell off the SPR to fill near-term budget holes unrelated to energy security are shortsighted‚Ä¶Strategic stocks remain valuable as a tool of international cooperation and soft power. They also enhance America‚Äôs ability to take foreign policy actions that may adversely affect oil markets, such as the recent decision to reimpose oil sanctions on Iran‚Ä¶ Assessing the right size of the US SPR is, in some ways, an impossible task. An early version of the stochastic dynamic programming models developed in the 1980s, for example, concluded that the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù size of the SPR could be anywhere between 0.8 and 4.4 billion barrels, depending on the DOE‚Äôs assumptions‚Ä¶Given the level of ambiguity about future oil market trends, the changing nature of supply risks to the oil market, and the risk of increased volatility in a period of a highly uncertain energy transition, policymakers would be well advised to proceed with caution rather than sell off the nation‚Äôs oil security arsenal.\r\n\r\nWhat‚Äôs the Real Answer?\r\nI don‚Äôt know. But after reading the material referenced in this discussion (and many other un-referenced articles and reports) I‚Äôm reasonably confident that the majority of Republican criticism of the 2021-2023 SPR draw-downs does not originate from an objective and principled policy stance, and I find most of it flatly hollow23 in light of Congressional SPR sale mandates in laws passed by a Republican Congress and mostly signed by President Trump. The position that a planned SPR inventory of ~400M barrels and the closure of 2 of the 4 storage sites by the end of 2027 is fine and good (we don‚Äôt need them) but an SPR of ~350M in 2023 with requirements for partial replacements in law is a national security catastrophe exhibits at the very least, some incoherence.\r\nI‚Äôm also tremendously confident that assessing whether a particular SPR action was ‚Äúgood‚Äù, ‚Äúbad‚Äù, ‚Äúshort-sighted‚Äù, ‚Äúbrilliant‚Äù, ‚Äòreckless‚Äô etc. is very, very difficult and people who spend decades studying such problems disagree.\r\nWere the Biden Administration‚Äôs SPR sales a reckless abuse of a national security asset for political gain? I‚Äôm reasonably certain that politics was part of the calculus but it is inaccurate to characterize those actions as entirely reckless or as an abuse of the SPR solely for political gain ahead of the election. I find such a characterization inaccurate because:\r\nAs the economy emerged from pandemic induced reductions of petroleum demand, and subsequent reductions in petroleum supplies, increasing demand outpaced increasing supply production. U.S. petroleum consumption returned to pre-pandemic levels by late June of 2021, while U.S. and global petroleum production wouldn‚Äôt return to pre-pandemic levels until 202324. Suppliers follow market signals and production ramp ups take time. In this supply constrained market, the price of crude oil climbed from $15.18 a barrel in April 2020 to $78.51 a barrel by April 2021 ‚Äì a 7 year high25.\r\nSharp spikes in petroleum prices frequently precede global recessions (eg. 1973, 1980‚Äì82, 1990, 2000 and 2008) (Reynolds 2022).\r\nIn Feb 2022 Russia invaded Ukraine. Anticipation of a global supply disruption resulting from war in Europe amid rapidly increasing oil prices climbing from the post-pandemic economy was a legitimate concern. By March, 2022 crude oil was trading at $107 a barrel (a 10 year high). SPR sales in March and April of 2022 were part of a coordinated release among IEA member states who voted unanimously to execute the action. Conservative policy analyst Alan Reynolds26 characterized the 2022 release as ‚Äú‚Ä¶only the second time that the SPR has been used for the purpose Congress intended in 1975 ‚Äì to counteract temporary spikes in the global price of oil due to cartel extortion or foreign wars‚Äù (Reynolds 2022).\r\nThere are of course legitimate criticisms of the SPR releases. Most scholars seem to agree that the sales were largely ineffective and argue that SPR releases in general have limited capability to impact global markets.\r\nWas the Republican and conservative media reaction to Biden Administration SPR sales a political stunt for short term political gain? I find the data indicates the characterizations of SPR sales reviewed in this document were either misleading political rhetoric or plainly false propaganda.\r\nCaveats\r\nAt most, this documents reflects about 50 hours of labor. It almost certainly contains errors, omissions that should have been included, and misunderstandings. I think to gain a thorough understanding of this issue would require, for me, perhaps 200-400 hours. I do not typically study energy policy and before writing this, knew nothing about the Strategic Petroleum Reserve beyond the basic fact of its existence, and was unfamiliar with any of these specific statements or articles.\r\nMy hope in writing this is to illuminate the nature of political rhetoric around complex geopolitical and economic issues. Every topic is like this. Every statement from every politician or pundit requires 10‚Äôs of hours of study to verify and understand because politicians are almost exclusively seeking to influence voters to vote for their party and pundits are almost exclusively seeking to sell clicks and advertisements to their audiences, who mostly come seeking bias confirmation and viewpoint validation (I‚Äôm on the good side) ‚Äì no one wants to buy a pile of ‚Äú‚Ä¶its complicated and everyone is lying to you.‚Äù\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBamberger, Robert. 2009. ‚ÄúThe Strategic Petroleum Reserve: History, Perspectives, and Issues.‚Äù RL33341.

Despite any particular ideological view on isolationism, the economy is global and the United States must either lead in cooperation with international partners or be subject to economic changes driven by other nations likely to be US competitors (China, Russia).‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\n https://x.com/realLizUSA/status/1509521690803507208‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nNormal here refers to statistical frequency and does not impart any sense of these actions being ethically acceptable.‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nI intended to when I set out, but it will take too long and no one is paying me for this.‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nStocks of crude oil in the SPR for 10/13/2023 were 351,274,000 barrels per https://www.eia.gov/dnav/pet/hist/LeafHandler.ashx?n=PET&s=WCSSTUS1&f=W ‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nWhen I downloaded this data the latest month included was May 2024, but as I‚Äôm writing now on Sep 8, 2024 the website has added data for the month of June.‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nMaximum distribution from all sites combined (https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2023-03/2023%20SPR%20Distribuiton%20Brochure_0.pdf)‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nSee https://afdc.energy.gov/data/10621‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nOne strict definition of deplete is simply to ‚Äúlessen markedly in quantity‚Äù but most connotations and I argue, most American English usage implies ‚Äúa reduction in number or quantity so as to endanger the ability to function‚Äù. See https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/deplete‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nHe was not ‚Äòcaught‚Äô selling SPR oil ‚Äúto China‚Äù. DOE sells SPR oil on the global market to the highest bidder, by law; Chinese companies have purchased some of the oil sold from SPR. This is not unusual because China is the 2nd largest buyer of US petroleum products after Mexico, each purchasing 11% and 10% of US petroleum sold on the global market respectively, every day. This claim likely originates from assertions made by Rep.¬†James Comer (R. KY) in committee meetings and in letters to the Energy Secretary implying the sale to this particular company may enrich Hunter Biden because an equity firm to which H.Biden has ties invested a large sum of money in that company several years prior. Rep.¬†Comer does not expound on why that company paying the highest price for US oil on the market on a particular day would enrich H.Biden. Thoroughly examining this claim would require another one of these documents and another 10-20 hours of labor. See: https://www.eia.gov/tools/faqs/faq.php?id=727&t=6 ‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nAt the time this comment was made (late 2023), the United States was the number one ‚Äúseller‚Äù of oil if sales include domestic sales. The US has been the highest oil producing country in the world for every year since 2018, continuing a long trend that started around 2009.

It seems unlikely policy changes would effect measurable production changes in 10 days, and our data is aggregated by month so Feb seems the most reasonable start time to measure any potential effect of ‚Äòday one‚Äô policy change.‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nFor the 1 billionth time.‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nIt‚Äôs possible President Trump was mis-remembering a proposal from his administration in March of 2020 after oil prices fell sharply to spend $3 Billion buying 77M barrels of oil from US producers to fill the SPR as part of a pandemic stimulus bill. The Democrat controlled Senate stripped that funding from the bill, characterizing it as a ‚Äúbail out for big oil‚Äù (Hulac 2020). Republicans asserted the purchases were to be made from smaller oil suppliers but the practicality of such a plan may not have been viable as small producers had limited access to pipeline bandwidth or other transportation to move stocks to the SPR salt caverns in Texas (Kumar 2020). Regardless, the program was never implemented, but previously scheduled mandated SPR sales were delayed because it didn‚Äôt make sense to add more oil to a supply rich market, sold at a low price (Hulac 2020) Understanding the data and political motivations related to this event would require another one of these documents and another 15-30 hours of labor.‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nBipartisan Budget Act of 2015, 21st Century Cures Act, Fixing America‚Äôs Surface Transportation Act, An Act to Provide for Reconciliation Pursuant to Titles II and V of the Current Resolution on the Budget for Fiscal Year 2018, Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018, Consolidated Appropriations Act 2018‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nAs of the date when I downloaded the data from EIA ‚Äì Aug, 30 2024.‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\nPrior to writing this document in response to a statement I heard, I had spent approximately 0 hours per year studying energy policy.

    "contents": "\r\nMemes excel at attracting attention and focus for short duration, high impact information injections. The combination of a compelling image with just the right words can effect a specific psychological response in the viewer and we would be naive to reject the suggestion that at least some of the memes flitting across the internet are precision-guided information munitions crafted by our adversaries and targeted with malign intent. Most are probably cats, many are probably just constructed by people trying to amplify a viewpoint that conforms to the in-group‚Äôs viewpoint. Today‚Äôs examination is of one more closely aligned to the last category.\r\nWhat‚Äôs in a Meme?\r\nFrequently, memes contain misleading information, misinformation, logical fallacies, and manipulative intent. I recently came across the following:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis meme, like many memes, has a lot going on, and presents an interesting opportunity for study.\r\nIt seems like that statement (or similar forms of it) has been misattributed to Pasteur since around 1920 (consult the google). It is almost certainly a reconstruction of Francis Bacon‚Äôs essay ‚ÄúOf Atheism‚Äù (written ~1612) which includes the passage\r\n\r\n‚ÄúIt is true, that a little philosophy inclineth man‚Äôs mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy bringeth men‚Äôs minds about to religion‚Äù (Bacon 1612).\r\n\r\nThe change in attribution likely seeks to exploit Pasteur‚Äôs household name recognition (all the kids learn about Pasteurized milk).\r\nThe attribution to a widely recognized scientific figure, amplified by the annotation indicating Pasteur is the father of two fields of study is probably intended as a, logically fallacious, appeal to authority. Being the father of two fields of study is better than one but at least with respect to microbiology that attribution usually goes further back to Leeuwenhoek who discovered protists and bacteria and reported results in a 1677 paper (Lane 2015).\r\nPasteur‚Äôs place as the father of immunology is more credible but still debated by some scholars. Smith (2012) recognizes Pasteur‚Äôs achievements but candidly discusses seeming breeches of integrity in the competition with M. Toussaint in 1880 when they were both developing an anthrax vaccine. Toussiant developed a vaccine that incorporated dead bacteria that was effective in a trials of dogs and sheep. Pasteur‚Äôs theory at the time insisted on live pathogens depleting the host of some essential nutrient required to support pathogen reproduction and he sharply criticized Toussaint‚Äôs methods. A challenge arose and Pasteur administered a vaccine that succeeded well. In his public discussion of methods he stated ‚Äú‚Ä¶living vaccines, cultivatable at will, transportable anywhere without alteration, and, lastly, prepared by a method that one may consider capable of generalization since it served a previous time for a discovery of the chicken cholera vaccine.‚Äù The actual vaccine he used in the test was not based on live cultured bacteria, but was based on another method similar to Toussaint‚Äôs that killed the bacteria with potassium bichromate. Pastuer was lauded and Smith (2012) reports that ‚ÄúToussaint subsequently published only 2 more scientific papers before he died in 1890 at the age of 43, after suffering a mental breakdown.‚Äù\r\nOf course that history isn‚Äôt particularly relevant to the analysis of our meme, but it was interesting to learn. So what else is going on? The statement of the meme itself, misattributed to authoritative appeal, is demonstrably false in the sense that such a relationship is not evident. Available data is mixed, but most likely supports the opposite trend, particularly respecting deep scientific knowledge.\r\nA 2017 Pew survey (Pew Research Center 2017) found that ‚ÄúOverall, U.S. adults with college degrees are less religious than others, but this pattern does not hold among Christians‚Äù. The specificity of these results is low. Measures are self reported frequency of prayer and belief in God etc. The Pew Survey acknowledges the previous work of Schwandel (2011) that finds ‚Äúeducation negatively affects exclusivist religious viewpoints and biblical literalism but not belief in God or the afterlife‚Äù and other positive associations between education levels and religious activities.\r\nThe Pew survey examines relationships within denominational groups and finds opposing trends depending on group affiliation. Catholics, Latter-Day Saints, Historically black Protestants and Evangelicals all exhibit positive correlations between education levels (High School ‚Äì> Undergraduate Degree) and the percentage believing ‚Äúin God with absolute certainty‚Äù. Mainline Protestants and the religiously unaffiliated exhibit negative correlations between High School and College education levels (Figure 1)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Percentage of Survey Participants who ‚Äúbelieve in God with absolute certainty‚Äù, difference between high school and college education. Data from: (Pew Research Center 2017)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA limitation in the data above to the analysis of our meme is that those results are related to education in general, most of which probably falls under the ‚Äúlittle science‚Äù bracket. So what does depth of knowledge impart to religiosity?\r\nAn international survey of 9,422 physicists and biologists in 2016 (Ecklund et al. 2016) found the percentage of respondents indicating an absolute belief in God was less than or equal to 20% for all countries included except Turkey (61%) and India (26%).1 The proportion of physicists and biologists indicating absolute belief in God in the United States was 10%.\r\nA 2009 Pew Research Survey (Pew Research Center 2009) among members of the American Association for the Advancement of Science found\r\n\r\n‚Äújust over half of scientists (51%) believe in some form of deity or higher power; specifically, 33% of scientists say they believe in God, while 18% believe in a universal spirit or higher power. By contrast, 95% of Americans believe in some form of deity or higher power‚Äù\r\n\r\nThat same Pew survey found Physics and Astronomy to exhibit the highest rate of non-belief (46% do not believe in God or in a universal spirit or higher power) and that older scientists were less likely to believe (48% do not believe among 65+ vs 32% among 18-34)\r\nLarson and Witham (1998) illustrate that this trend is not new, reporting that\r\n\r\nUS psychologist James H. Leuba [found in] his landmark survey of 1914‚Ä¶that 58% of 1,000 randomly selected US scientists expressed disbelief or doubt in the existence of God, and that this figure rose to near 70% among the 400 ‚Äúgreater‚Äù scientists within his sample. Leuba repeated his survey in somewhat different form 20 years later, and found that these percentages had increased to 67 and 85, respectively. In 1996, we repeated Leuba‚Äôs 1914 survey and reported our results in Nature. We found little change from 1914 for American scientists generally, with 60.7% expressing disbelief or doubt. This year, we closely imitated the second phase of Leuba‚Äôs 1914 survey to gauge belief among ‚Äúgreater‚Äù scientists, and find the rate of belief lower than ever ‚Äî a mere 7% of respondents.\r\n\r\nSo a brief examination of the literature suggests that Bacon may have gotten it wrong back in 1612 ‚Äì of course he might have gotten it exactly right in 1612 but we don‚Äôt have any contemporaneous data. At the very least I have not found any evidence in the literature that supports the notion that the deeper the science knowledge a person attains the more likely they are to be ‚Äúa believer in God.‚Äù The data seem to indicate the opposite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBacon, Francis. 1612. ‚ÄúEssays.‚Äù https://www.gutenberg.org/files/56463/56463-h/56463-h.htm).\r\n\r\n\r\nEcklund, E, D Johnson, C Scheitle, K Matthews, and S Lewis. 2016. ‚ÄúReligion Among Scientists in International Context: A New Study of Scientists in Eight Regions.‚Äù Socius 2. https://doi.org/10.1177/2378023116664353.\r\n\r\n\r\nLane, Nick. 2015. ‚ÄúThe Unseen World: Reflections on Leeuwenhoek (1677) ‚ÄòConcerning Little Animals‚Äô.‚Äù Philos Trans R Soc Lond B Biol Sci 370 (1666). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4360124/#:~:text=Leeuwenhoek%20is%20universally%20acknowledged%20as,with%20the%20power%20to%20see.\r\n\r\n\r\nLarson, E, and L Witham. 1998. ‚ÄúLeading Scientists Still Reject God.‚Äù Nature 394 (313). https://doi.org/10.1038/28478.\r\n\r\n\r\nPew Research Center. 2009. ‚ÄúReligion and Science in the United States.‚Äù Pew Research Center. https://www.pewresearch.org/religion/2009/11/05/scientists-and-belief/.\r\n\r\n\r\n‚Äî‚Äî‚Äî. 2017. ‚ÄúIn America, Does More Education Equal Less Religion?‚Äù Pew Research Center. https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/20/2017/04/Religion-and-education-FULL-REPORT.pdf.\r\n\r\n\r\nSchwadel, Philip. 2011. ‚ÄúThe Effects of Education on Americans‚Äô Religious Practices, Beliefs, and Affiliations.‚Äù Review of Religious Research 53 (November): 161‚Äì82. https://doi.org/10.1007/s13644-011-0007-4.\r\n\r\n\r\nSmith, Kendall. 2012. ‚ÄúLouis Pasteur, the Father of Immunology?‚Äù Frontiers in Immunology 3 (68). https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3342039/#:~:text=Louis%20Pasteur%20is%20traditionally%20considered,well%20as%20also%20treated%20by.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe majority of the scientists in Turkey were Muslim and the majority in India were Hindu.‚Ü©Ô∏é\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\nSolaren has not yet launched their space-based solar generation system (which didn‚Äôt include lasers anyway) (Solaren 2021) when Rep Greene made her original post (since deleted)1, so this particular claim cannot be true 2. However, since the system is still under development, a design opportunity exists for Jewish space laser enthusiasts. We develop a crude feasible design region for Jewish Space Lasers capable of igniting wood or grass from geosynchronous orbit with respect to wavelength (visible spectrum), laser aperture, and total system power. These calculations represent a rough order of magnitude estimate for system requirements and will facilitate the development of future Jewish Space-based laser platforms.\r\nJewish Space Laser Architecture\r\n(not to scale)\r\n\r\nSystem Requirements\r\nThe authors conducted user base surveys to elicit the needs of the Jewish Space Laser enthusiast community using a modified Delphi panel method3. The modifications to the panel method reduced cost and facilitated rapid requirements development. For this analysis the laser system under examination must:\r\nOccupy a geosynchronous orbit above North America\r\nChange orientation (targeting) using reaction wheel assemblies and magnetic torquers (based on Hubble Space Telescope design) 4\r\nProduce a beam in the blue wavelengths (\\(\\lambda = 450 nm\\), based on user surveys)\r\nSupport variable output power range such that the beam energy density at earth surface can either toast a bagel to perfection or destroy all threats (ignite wood and brush, instill fear and suspicion)\r\nProduce a flat top beam profile (because it makes our calculations for energy density requirements at Earth surface simpler)\r\nAssumptions\r\nSince this effort was executed without funding or expertise, we make the following simplifying assumptions:\r\nTotal wall plug efficiency of the laser system accounting for power required for cooling systems, communications, satellite orientation, navigation, computer controls systems, heat loss, and orbit maintenance is 15%. This number is commensurate with various other laser systems (Shammi 2018) and the 2.2 MJ pulse laser at the National Ignition Facility (Bayramian et al. 2011).\r\nThe laser beam quality is evaluated for assumed values of beam propagation ratios (\\(M^2\\)) where \\(M^2 \\in [3,20]\\). High energy multi-modal lasers tend to exhibit poor beam quality (NewportCorporation 2021). Zlobina et al (2017) demonstrate techniques to improve beam quality, reducing \\(M^2\\) in a 50W CW Raman laser from 26 to 2.6. High energy pulse lasers with near diffraction limited Gaussian beams are possible (Miller et al. 2020), but nanosecond pulse laser systems are probably ill suited for fire starting. Additionally a nano-second pulse laser is less likely to be visually observed by conspiracy minded individuals. A tertiary consideration for expending the resources required to deploy an extraordinarily expensive and impractical technology solution into orbit (that achieves the same effect as a plausibly deniable gender reveal party) is the subtle fear we may inspire in our adversaries as they whisper of space laser threats to their blood and soil. There is no purer mechanism to burn the blood and scorch the soil than the raw essence of the universe, packaged into photons descending from the heavens at Jewish wavelengths.\r\nFeasible laser apertures or beam waists (\\(W_0\\) ) range from 40cm - 200 cm. Larger apertures are desirable because they minimize beam divergence. The National Ignition Facility laser elements each use an optical aperture of 40 cm so we know this is feasible (for a multi-pass pulse laser architecture on Earth surface anyway). Laser apertures up to 10 km may be possible with coherent laser arrays such as those suggested for light sail propulsion (Fugate and Green 2017), but the complexities of constructing and tuning such an array for an orbital platform seem daunting so we ignore them here.\r\nThe next section describes assumptions related to beam propagation in the atmosphere. Simple assumptions regarding high energy laser propagation through the atmosphere are not evident in the literature, so we present a short discussion before giving up.\r\nThe Atmosphere\r\nThe atmosphere is‚Ä¶problematic. Experiments and theoretical work performed in the 1960‚Äôs and 70‚Äôs demonstrate that high energy lasers suffer from beam wander and wave front errors propagating through a turbulent medium (Hogge 1974). The wave front errors seem particularly challenging because the beam itself heats the atmosphere as it propagates, which modifies the refractive properties of the atmosphere, which modifies the propagation of the beam (thermal blooming). Hogge (1974) provides some incomprehensible equations and charts5 that describe these effects. Figure 1 seems to illustrate relationships between beam energy at aperture and beam energy in the focal plane (for an unspecified distance and unspecified wavelength) in turbulent conditions. The linear relationships represent theoretical maximums. The sad reveal is that there is a point of optimal beam energy in the focal plane after which increased aperture energies actually reduce focal plane energies (presumably because of increased thermal blooming). This affect may not be as pronounced for our system because the beam diameter will be quite large at Earth atmosphere, but without advanced calculations specific to this problem it‚Äôs not possible to assess how this particular beam will behave.\r\n\r\nWe gave up on the atmosphere.\r\nSeems hard.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Some incomprehensible charts from: https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/tr/pdf/AD0781763.pdf\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSuppose we consider our beam originating at the edge of earth atmosphere rather than at geosynchronous orbit. It still must propagate through about 96 km of atmosphere to earth surface where dry vegetation awaits combustion. If we assume for the present that combustion of dry wood is achievable with a 1W laser focused to a 6mm2 spot this results in an energy density of 166,666 \\(\\frac{W}{m^2}\\).\r\n\r\nIs it a coincidence that a hypothesized energy density to create fire (hell) includes the mark of the Beast? We merely pose this question for the reader.\r\nEven a Gaussian beam originating at geosynchronous orbit would be over 20m in diameter at the edge of the atmosphere for the range of apertures considered here. Further simplifying this discussion, if we assume the beam does not diverge for the remainder of the trip and there is no energy loss for the last 96km, the total energy in the beam at the edge of earth atmosphere to the meet the energy density required for ignition we speculate above would be:\r\n\\[\\frac{166,666W}{m^2}[\\pi(10m)^2]= 52,359,668W\\]\r\nA 20m diameter laser with total beam energy of 52MW puts us well beyond Hogge‚Äôs calculations above. We frankly have no idea what will happen and suggest consulting with a team of laser and atmospheric physicists and photonics and optics experts.\r\nWe assume the total energy density effect of the atmosphere on the beam is 1/10 (irrespective of wavelength or laser aperture), but we have no idea what we‚Äôre doing, this might not work at all] \r\nMethods\r\nDetermining required beam energy density at earth surface\r\nWe estimated the beam energy density required to ignite vegetation and toast bagels by experimenting with a low power (~\\(10^0 W\\)) retail laser at 450nm. Figure 2 illustrates the layout of the experiments. Two experiments of the same design evaluate power requirements to either toast bagels or destroy all threats (ignite dry biomass). Destroying threats requires more energy density than toasting bagels, so this paper is limited to that use case as a design driver. We secured the laser in a 2-axis machining vice with the aim point at either various segments of the bagel or at a pile of dry sticks. Distance deviations achieved by moving the machining vice along the axis of beam prorogation modified the beam convergence at the target and thus simulated lasers of different energy densities. Beam spot size was measured directly at the target distance with dial calipers (to calculate energy density for a known laser power output). We recharged the laser batteries between tests to ensure power output did not diminish over the experiment.\r\n\r\nThis experiment proved quite tedious, so these results are approximate, and possibly fabricated. We feel such a methodology is appropriate for this genre of research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 2: Laser ignition experiment configuration\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIs it a coincidence that the result of our experiment was exactly the previously hypothesized power requirement?\r\nCalculating the resulting orbital platform power requirement\r\nA basic calculation is possible with a few simple formulas. The beam divergence half angle \\(\\theta\\), in radians, is given by:\r\n\\[\r\n\\theta = M^2\\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi W_0}\r\n\\]\r\nSo we can calculate the area of the beam \\(B_A\\) at a given distance (assuming a circular beam shape with M2 equal in both axes) with some simple geometry as:\r\n\\[\r\nB_A = \\pi(\\theta d)^2\r\n\\]\r\nwhere \\(d\\) is the propagation distance from the aperture in meters (from geosynchronous orbit \\(d = 35,786,000m\\)).\r\nAdding some notation we let:\r\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\\({E_d}^*\\) be energy density required at Earth surface to ignite vegetation or toast bagels\r\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\\(A = 0.1\\) be the total effect of the atmosphere on the beam energy\r\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\\(Ef_{wp} = 0.15\\) be the total wall-plug efficiency of the laser system\r\n¬†¬†¬†¬†¬†\\(P_s\\) be the total system power in geosynchronous orbit\r\nSince the energy density at Earth surface will be the total energy in the beam distributed over the beam area then\r\n\\[\r\nE_d = \\frac{P_sAEf_{wp}}{\\pi(\\theta d)^2}\r\n\\]\r\nWe can rearrange this equation with all the original terms to solve for a system power requirement that will yield the required energy density of our laser system at Earth surface \\({E_d}^*\\) based on our assumptions above.\r\n\\[\r\nP_s = \\frac{{E_d}^*{\\pi(M^2\\frac{\\lambda}{\\pi W_0} d)^2}}{AEf_{wp}}\r\n\\]\r\nResults\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe executed the calculation developed in the previous section at the values of laser aperture and \\(M^2\\) defined above for a beam with \\(\\lambda = 450nm\\) (a lovely vibrant blue). We also examined the effect of wavelength on the requirements between \\(445nm\\) and \\(490nm\\) but the effect is very small compared to the aperture and beam propagation ratio so we did not include those results. Figure 3 illustrates the relationship between laser aperture and system power requirements for a given beam propagation ratio (\\(M^2\\)). Achieving a large aperture will be critical to feasibility. A 40cm aperture requires at least 39 GW of power in geosynchronous orbit, which doesn‚Äôt seem feasible, or at least affordable. For reference the Palo Verde nuclear power plant in Arizona is the largest in the U.S with a maximum capacity of about 4 GW.\r\n4 GW of Nuclear Power at Palo Verde\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 3: Sensitivity of system power requirements to laser characteristics\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSolaren‚Äôs planned solar power generation plant will generate 200 MW by design. Based on our assumptions regarding feasible apertures, propagation ratios, wall plug efficiency, and the effect of the atmosphere, the minimal power plant capacity required to support this system is 1550 MW.\r\nWe encourage the Jewish Space Laser enthusiast community to use these results to inform future system designs and technology investments. Developing large aperture, high quality beams is critical to the feasibility of deploying such a ridiculous system. While staging a pyrotechnic gender reveal party or having an agent toss a lighter is astronomically cheaper, these tactics lack the Bond villain essence of parody that apparently smacks of truth to some members of Congress.\r\nAcknowledgements\r\nI think we all know who‚Äôs behind this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBayramian, A, S Aceves, T Anklam, K Baker, E Bliss, C Boley, A Bullington, et al. 2011. ‚ÄúCompact, Efficient Laser Systems Required for Laser Inertial Fusion Energy.‚Äù Fusion Science an Technology 60 (July): 28. https://doi.org/10.13182/FST10-313.\r\n\r\n\r\nFugate, Robert, and Wesley Green. 2017. ‚ÄúThe Sharshot Propulsion System.‚Äù In Proceedings of the Tennessee Valley Interstellar Workshop, 5‚Äì21.
