This nonsense is mostly to do with humans being intellectually lazy in the way we consume and accept information (except for me, obviously). One of my favorite people that I don’t actually know is Richard Feynman, who told the BBC in 1981:\r\n\r\n“See, I have the advantage of having found out how hard it is to get to really know something, how careful you have to be about checking the experiments, how easy it is to make mistakes and fool yourself. I know what it means to know something and therefore, [with obvious vitriol] I see how they get their information and I can’t believe that they know it; they haven’t done the work necessary; haven’t done the checks necessary; haven’t done the care necessary. I have a great suspicion that they don’t know that this stuff is … [He trails off; my impression was that he suppressed diction the BBC would have had to censor]”\r\n\r\nFeynman was a physicist. He made the statement in response to pseudo-scientific experts and claims of the time. I don’t presume to have such an auspicious advantage, but I have a more commonplace one in that I have tried to really get to know something and in the process discovered the vast aquifer of ignorance under the serene pool of superficial knowledge that tourists photograph from the overpass. It’s really staggeringly difficult to become even reasonably knowledgeable about a complicated subject. It takes work, checks, and care.\r\nSo when I observe what’s obvious nonsense to me, because I see how people get their information and I can’t believe, I occasionally feel the need to push back. I’m going to explore using this blog to do that, hopefully in a fun meaningful way. The trouble though is that nonsense is near free and refuting nonsense–really demonstrating that it is in fact nonsense–requires Feynman’s work and checks and care; which requires time and effort. So most of the time instead of meaningful and fun I’ll settle for just fun.\r\nThis will be a place to share things I learn, refute things that are demonstrably false and important to falsify, and examine the world when it seems interesting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
